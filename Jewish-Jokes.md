### #13 The school teacher’s prize.

Angela was nearing 60 and was in her final year of teaching. She was a devout Christian who missed teaching from the Bible. Because she was worried at how little her class knew about religion, Angela decided she was going to disregard the new regulations and teach some religion. She told her class that she would run a contest. She would give £50 to whoever could tell her who was the greatest man who ever lived.

Immediately Moishe began to wave his hand, but Angela ignored him in favour of those in her Sunday school class. As she went around the room, Angela was disappointed with the answers she got. Jane, her best scholar, picked Noah because he saved all the animals. Others said, "I think the greatest man who ever lived was Alexander the Great because he conquered the whole world." and "I think it was Thomas Edison, because he invented the light bulb."

Finally, she called on Moishe who still had his hand in the air.

"I think the greatest man who ever lived was Jesus Christ." said Moishe. Angela was shocked but still gave him the £50 reward. As she did so, she said, "Well, Moishe, I'm very surprised that you should be the only one with the right answer. How come?"

"Well, to tell you the truth," Moishe replied as he pocketed the money, "I think it was Moses, but business is business."

### #27 The Jewish advisor.

There once lived a king who had an advisor called Hymie. The king relied so much on the wisdom of Hymie that one day he decided to promote him to chief advisor. But the other advisors objected.

They said, "It's OK sitting in counsel with a Jew, but to allow him to boss us about would be unacceptable."

The King accepted their argument and ordered Hymie to convert. Hymie had to obey the King.

But soon after, Hymie felt great remorse and over the months that followed he became despondent, his health suffered and he grew weak.

Finally Hymie could take it no longer and made a decision. He went to the king and said, "I was born a Jew and a Jew I will always be. So do whatever you want with me."

The King had no idea Hymie felt so strong about his 'conversion'.

"OK," said the King, "if that's how you feel, go be a Jew again. The other advisors will just have to live with it. You're too important for me to lose."

On his way back home to tell the news to his family, Hymie felt the strength surge back into his body.

When he arrived, he called out to his wife, "Sarah, we can be Jews again, we can be Jews again."

Sarah glared at him and said, "Couldn't you wait until after Passover?"

### #28 The phone call.

Morris calls his son in New York.

Morris says "Benny, I have something to tell you. However, I don't want to discuss it. I'm merely telling you because you're my oldest child, and I thought you ought to know. I've made up my mind, I'm divorcing your mother."

The son is shocked, and asks his father to tell him what happened.

"I don't want to get into it. My mind is made up."

"But Dad, you just can't decide to divorce Mum just like that after 54 years together. What happened?"

"It's too painful to talk about it. I only called because you're my son, and I thought you should know. I really don't want to get into it anymore than this. You can call your sister and tell her. It will spare me the pain."

"But where's Mum? Can I talk to her?"

"No, I don't want you to say anything to her about it. I haven't told her yet. Believe me it hasn't been easy. I've agonised over it for several days, and I've finally come to a decision. I have an appointment with my Edgware lawyer the day after tomorrow."

"Dad, don't do anything rash. I'm going to take the first flight to London. Promise me that you won't do anything until I get there."

"Well, all right, I promise. Next week is Passover. I'll hold off seeing the lawyer until after the Seder. Call your sister in New Jersey and break the news to her. I just can't bear to talk about it anymore."

A half hour later, Morris receives a call from his daughter who tells him that she and her brother were able to get tickets and that they and the children will be arriving at Heathrow the day after tomorrow.

"Benny told me that you don't want to talk about it on the telephone, but promise me that you won't do anything until we both get there."

Morris promises.

After hanging up from his daughter, Morris turns to his wife and says, "Well, it worked this time, they’re coming for Seder night, but we are going to have to come up with a new idea to get them here Rosh Hashanah."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a Man for you."

"What's a Man, Lord?"

"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat, and be very competitive; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But, he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things. He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining, I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be too smart, so he'll also need your advice to think properly."

"Sounds great." says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow.

"But, what's the catch, Lord?"

"Well... you can have him on one condition."

"What's that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring... So you'll have to let him believe that I made him first... Just remember, it's our little secret---You know, Woman to Woman."

"No," moans Betty, "it's still too much."

Maurice and Sarah were getting old and Maurice felt his wife was losing her hearing.

He decided to stage a test. One day, as Sarah read the paper, he stood a distance behind her chair and said, in a conversational voice, "Can you hear me?" Silence.

Finally, he moved directly behind her chair and bent over, just inches from her ear "Can you hear me?"

Sarah replied "For the third time, Maurice, Yes I can!"

### #46 The accident

Maurice and Sadie were in a terrible accident in which Sadie’s face was severely burned.

The doctor told Maurice that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too thin.  So Maurice offered to donate some of his own skin.  However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his tuchass.

Maurice and Sadie agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honour their secret. After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at Sadie’s new beauty.  She looked more beautiful than she ever had before!  All her friends and relatives just went on and  on about her youthful beautiful skin!

One day, she was alone with Maurice and she was overcome with emotion at this sacrifice.  She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me.  There is no way I could ever repay you."

### #70 At the hairdressers

Sadie says, "So nu, Rose, how's that daughter of yours?"

Rose replies, "She's OK thanks. She married a fantastic man. He's got such a good job in the City that she gave up her secretary's job. She stays at home but never needs to cook, because he always takes her out, or clean the house, because he got her a maid, or worry about my 2 lovely  grandchildren, because he got her a live-in nanny."

Sadie then asks, "And how's your son?"

Rose replies, "His life is awful. He married a bitch from hell. She never cooks anything and makes him take her out to dinner every night. God forbid she should vacuum a carpet, so she made him get her a maid. He has to work like a dog because she refuses to get a job and she never takes care of my grandson because she made him get her a nanny."

Then came the turn of Avrahom. The crowd waited, and waited...and then Avrahom crossed the line in .....three minutes!

"What happened to you?" asked the team coach when Avrahom finally got back.

Avrahom replied, "Which one of those bastards fixed a mezuzah to each gate?"

"My last wish," began the Rabbi, is to give a fascinating, complicated, long sermon that I have always wanted to but never been allowed to give."

"We will grant your wish," the hijackers replied.

"My last wish," said the cantor, "is to sing a beautiful, Yemenite style song, one of my own compositions lasting two hours. I have never been allowed to sing it."

"We'll let you sing it," replied the hijackers.

"What is your last wish," the hijackers asked the shul president.

"Please, please shoot me now."

### #77 The cow

A Polish town had just one cow to its name and its milk ran dry. The townsfolk did some research and bought a replacement cow from Minsk for only 1,000 rubles. It was a great cow, gave lots of milk and lots of cream. Everybody loved it.

Then the people decided they would mate the cow and get more cows and would never again have to worry about their milk supply. They bought a bull and led the cow and the bull into the pasture. But things were not that easy - when the bull came in from the right to mount the cow, the cow moved to the left and when the bull moved in to mount the cow from the left, the cow moved to the right. This went on all day.

In desperation, the people asked their rabbi what to do - he was very wise.

"Rabbi, we've tried all day to mate our cow, but when the bull moves in from the right the cow moves left, and vice versa. What shall we do?"

The Rabbi said to them, "Nu, why did you buy a Minsk cow?"

"Rabbi," they said, "you are so wise. We never told you that we bought the cow from Minsk. How did you know?"

The Rabbi said, "My wife is from Minsk."

### #79 The phone call to God

Billy Graham went to see the Pope in Rome. While he was waiting, Billy noticed a red phone. As he was ushered in to talk to the Pope, he asked, "What's the red phone for?"

"That's to talk to God," came the reply.

"Really," Billy gasped, "how much does such a call cost - it's an awful long way?"

"£10,000 a minute, but it's well worth it." answered the Pope.

Some weeks later, Billy Graham went to see the Chief Rabbi in Jerusalem. He noticed that he, too, had a red phone. "I don't suppose," asked Billy, "that this phone is to talk to God?"

"Yes it is." came the reply.

"And how much does that cost?" Billy inquired.

"Twenty pence a minute," shrugged the chief rabbi.

"How come it's so cheap?" Billy asked, "the Pope has a phone like that and it costs £10,000 a minute!"

"Well," grinned the Chief Rabbi, "From here it's just a local call."

### #82 The car crash

Rabbi Bloom and Father Michael get into a car accident and it's a bad one. Both cars are crushed but amazingly neither of the clerics is hurt. After they crawl out of their cars, Rabbi Bloom sees the priest's collar and says, "Just look at our cars - there's nothing left, but we're unhurt. You're a priest and I'm a rabbi so it must be a sign from God. He must have meant that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace the rest of our days."

Father Michael replies, "I agree with you completely. This truly must be a sign from God."

Rabbi Bloom then says, "Look - here's another miracle. Although my car is wrecked, this bottle of wine didn't break. God must want us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."

He hands the bottle to the priest.

Father Michael takes a few big swigs and passes the bottle back to Rabbi Bloom who puts the cork back in and hands it back to the priest.

Father Michael asks, "Aren't you having any wine?"

"No. I think I'll just wait for the police," says Rabbi Bloom.

"Have you ever married?" asked the doctor.

Moishe replied that he had been a bachelor his whole life.

"You might think about taking a wife," said the doctor, "after all, you'll need someone to look after you during the final illness."

"That's a good point," said Moishe, "and with only 6 months to live I better make the most of my remaining time."

"May I make one more suggestion?" asked the doctor, "marry a Jewish girl."

"A Jewish girl? Why?" asked Moishe.

### #94 Interview Question

There were four people who were in the final stages of interviewing for a prestigious job. One was Christian, one was Catholic, one was a Buddhist and the fourth was Bernie. The Company decided to fly them all in for dinner and a final interview.

Over dinner at a fine restaurant, the president of the company told them that all were very worthy applicants, and that he wished he could hire them all, but that they only had enough money budgeted to hire one person. He told them that the following day, he would call each of them in one at a time for a final interview and that he would ask each one of them the same question. Whoever answered the question the best would be the one hired. All applicants agreed that this was fair.

The next day the first applicant, the Christian, was called in. The president posed the question, "What is the fastest thing in the world?"

He thought for a moment and replied, "That would have to be a thought."

"Why do you say that?" asked the president.

"Well, a thought takes no time at all...it is in your mind in an instant, then gone again." "Ahh, very good. Thank you," replied the president.

Next the same question was posed to the Catholic woman.

"What is the fastest thing in the world?"

She paused and replied, "That would have to be a blink."

"Why?" asked the president.

"Because you don't even think about a blink, it's just a reflex. You do it in an instant." The president thanked her, then called in the next person.

The Buddhist was asked what the fastest thing in the world was, and after hesitating for a brief moment, he replied, "I would have to say electricity."

"Why?"

"Because a man can flip a switch, and immediately, three miles away a light will go on." "I see, very good," replied the president.

Then, Bernie was called in. He, too, was asked, "What is the fastest thing in the world?"

"That's easy..." he replied, "that would have to be diarrhoea!"

Rather stunned, the president asked, "Why do you say that?"

"Well, last night after dinner, I was lying in my bed and I got the worst stomach cramps..... and before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHTS......"

"Oy Vay, I never knew someone so stubborn. 'Havaii' is how it's pronounced." Isaac says.

And so it went on all the way till they got there.

As soon as they got off the plane, they asked a porter, "Now that we're on the island, you can settle an argument between my wife and I. Is this 'Hawaii' or 'Havaii?'"

"This is Havaii," replied the porter.

"Ha!" Isaac said, turning to Hetty, "See, didn't I tell you never to argue with me? I'm always right."

Just before they began to walk away, Isaac gave the porter a hearty "Thank you."

"You're Velcome."

### #96 A Rabbi

Rabbi Levine is walking slowly out of a Shul in Golders Green when a gust of wind blows his hat down the street. He's an old man and can't walk fast enough to catch his hat. Across the street, Bernie sees what's happening, rushes over, grabs the hat and returns it to Rabbi Levine.

"I don't think I would have been able to catch my hat." Rabbi Levine says. He places his hand on Bernie's shoulder and says, "May God bless you."

Bernie thinks, "I've just been blessed by the Rabbi, this must be my lucky day." So he goes into a betting shop and sees in the first race a horse named 'Top Hat' at 20 to 1. He bets £50 and the horse comes in first. In the second race, Bernie sees a horse named Fedora at 30 to 1 so he bets it all and this horse comes in first also.

When Bernie finally returns home to his wife, she asks him where he's been. He explains how he caught the Rabbi's hat and was blessed by him and then went to a betting office and started winning on horses that had a hat in their names.

"So where's the money?" she asks.

"I lost it all in the ninth race. I bet on a horse named Chateau and it lost."

"You fool, Chateau is a house, Chapeau is a hat."

"It doesn't matter," Bernie said, "the winner was some Japanese horse named Yarmulka."

### #97 Bernie

While leading the Friday evening services, the Rabbi noticed a member of the congregation, Bernie, walk in with a St. Bernard dog. The Rabbi, horrified, asked the Cantor to take over the service and went to talk to Bernie.

"What are doing here with a dog?"

"The dog came here to pray."

"Oh, come on." says the Rabbi.

"It's true," says Bernie.

"I don't believe you. You are just fooling around and that's not a proper thing to do in a synagogue."

"Its really true," says Bernie.

"OK," says the Rabbi (thinking he would call Bernie's bluff), "then show me what the dog can do."

"OK," says Bernie nodding to the dog. The dog opens up the barrel under his neck and removes a yarmulke, a tallis (and puts them on) and prayer book and then starts saying prayers in Hebrew!

The Rabbi is so shocked he listens for a full 15 minutes. When the Rabbi regains his composure, he is so impressed with the quality of the praying he says to Bernie. "Do you think your dog would consider going to Rabbinical school?"

Bernie, throwing up his hands in disgust says, "You talk to him, he wants to be a doctor!"

### #101 Spaceman Rabbi

NASA had sent many shuttles to orbit the earth and attempted to include passengers of all races, colour and creed. One day, they realised they hadn't invited anyone from the clergy so they invited a priest and a rabbi to orbit the earth.

Upon their return, they were asked to go straight to the Media room to give the world their impressions of the experience.

The priest came into the room with a smile on his face. His statement was full of joy. He said, "It was totally amazing. I saw the sun rise and set. I saw the beautiful oceans. I'm truly in awe."

But the rabbi came into the room completely dishevelled. His beard was tangled, his kippot was askew and his tallis was creased. The reporters asked him whether he enjoyed the experience.

He threw his hands in the air and said, "Enjoy? Oy vay, you must be joking. How could I find time to enjoy? Every few minutes the sun was rising and setting! So it was on with the tefillin, off with the tefillin, mincha, maariv, mincha, maariv.... Oy Gevalt."

### #102 Henry's big problem

Henry goes to the doctor's surgery to collect his wife Sarah’s test results.

The receptionist tells him, "I'm sorry, but there has been a bit of a mix-up. When we sent your wife's samples to the lab, they got mixed up with samples from another Mrs Cohen and we don't know which one is your wife's. The bottom line is that the situation is either bad or terrible."

"What do you mean?" says Henry.

"Well," says the receptionist, "one Mrs Cohen has tested positive for Alzheimer disease and the other for AIDS. We can't tell which is which."

"That's terrible," says Henry, "can you do the test again?"

"Normally, yes. But your private medical insurance policy won't pay for these expensive tests more than once."

"Well, what am I supposed to do?" says Henry.

The receptionist replies, "The doctor recommends that you drop your wife off in the middle of Oxford Street. If she finds her way home, don't sleep with her."

Maurice exclaims, "Amazing! This is Berschert. Hashem wanted us to meet! I can hardly believe our good luck at winding up in the same bar tonight. Can you believe it, I graduated from Yeshiva University in 1984 also."

About this time, Moishe enters the bar, sits down, and orders a beer. The bartender walks over to him shaking his head & mutters, "It's going to be a long night tonight, the Goldberg twins are drunk again."

### #104 Morris gets a dog

Morris gets a new dog and can't wait to show him off to Shlomo. So when Shlomo arrives, Morris calls the dog into the house, bragging about how smart he is. The dog quickly comes running and stands looking up at his master, tail wagging furiously, mouth open, tongue hanging out, eyes bright with anticipation.

Morris points to the newspaper on the couch and commands, "FETCH!"

Immediately, the dog climbs onto the couch and sits down. His tail wagging stops and the doggie-smile disappears.

Looking balefully up at his master, the dog says in a whiny voice, "You think this is easy wagging my tail all the time? Oy vay. It hurts from so much wagging. And do you think that expensive organic dog food you're feeding me is tasty? You try it. It's dreck - much too salty. And you just don't seem to care about me anymore. You just push me out the door to take a leak three times a day. I can't remember the last time you took me out for a walk."

Shlomo is amazed. "What the hell is that? Your dog is sitting there talking."

"Oh, I know", explains Morris, "He's young and I'm still training him. He thought I said KVETCH."

### #105 A serious chat With Mum

Rivkah sprang to answer the telephone.

"Darling, How are you? This is Mummy."

"Oh Mummy," Rivkah said crying, "I'm having a bad day. The baby won't eat and the washing machine won't work. I've sprained my ankle and I'm hobbling around. On top of all this, the house is a mess and I'm supposed to have the Minkys and the Rokens for dinner tonight. I haven't even had a chance to go shopping."

The voice on the other end said in sympathy, "Darling, let Mummy handle it.  Sit down, relax and close your eyes. I'll be over in half an hour. I'll do your shopping, tidy up the house and cook your dinner. I'll feed the baby and I'll call an engineer I know who'll fix your washing machine. Now stop crying. I'll even call your husband David at the office and tell him he should come home to help out for once."

"David?" said Rivkah. "Who's David?"

"Why, David 's your husband....Is this 0208 123 3749?"

"No, this is 0208 123 3747."

"Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I dialled the wrong number."

There was a short pause, then Rivkah said, "Does this mean you're not coming over?"

### #114 Taking it all with you

Issy was a rich man who was near death. He was very grieved because he had worked very hard for his money and wanted to be able to take it with him to heaven. So Issy begins to pray.

An angel hears his plea and says to him, "I'm sorry, but you can't take your wealth with you."

Issy implores the angel to speak to God to see if he might bend the rules. He said he would try. In the meantime, Issy continues to pray.

When the angel reappears, he informs Issy that God has decided to allow him to take one suitcase with him. Overjoyed, Issy gathers his largest suitcase and fills it with pure gold bars and places it beside his bed. Soon afterward he dies and shows up at the Gates of Heaven.

The angel Gabriel, seeing the suitcase, says, "Hold on, you can't bring that in here."

Issy explains that he has permission and suggests he verify his story with God.

Gabriel checks and says, "You're right. You're allowed one carry-on bag, but I'm supposed to check its contents before letting it through."

So Gabriel opens the suitcase to inspect the worldly goods that Issy found too precious to leave behind and exclaims, "You brought pavement?"

### #115 Watch that door!

Hymie, a wealthy American, retires to England and buys a fabulous English country home with over 50 rooms. He brings in a local workman to decorate the place.

When the job is finished Hymie is delighted but soon after realises that he's forgotten something. There are no mezuzahs on the doors.

He immediately goes out and buys 50 kosher mezuzot and asks the decorator to place them on the right hand side of each door except on the bathrooms. He's worried that the decorator won't put them up correctly.

However, the job is carried out entirely to his satisfaction and so he gives the workman an extra bonus. As the decorator is walking out of the door he says "Glad you're happy with the job mate. By the way, I took out all the guarantees that were in those little boxes and left them on the table for you."

### #117 Adam’s payment

After Adam was created, there he was, all alone, in the Garden of Eden.

Of course it wasn't good for him to be all by himself, so the Lord came down to visit.

"Adam," He said, "I have a plan to make you much, much happier.

I'm going to give you a companion, a help mate for you -- someone who will fulfil your every need and desire. Someone who will be faithful, loving and obedient. Someone who will make you feel wonderful every day of your life."

Adam was stunned. "That's sounds incredible!"

"Well, it is," replied the Lord. "But it doesn't come for free. This is someone so special that it's going to cost you an arm and a leg."

"That's a pretty high price to pay," said Adam. "What can I get for a rib?"

### #118 The confessions

Three friends were at the bar talking, and after many rounds of beer, one of them suggests that everyone admit something they have never admitted to anyone.

Okay," says Peter, "I've never told anybody I'm a gay!"

John confesses, "I'm having an affair with my boss's wife."

Moishe, begins, "I don't know how to tell you...."

"Don't be shy," said Peter and John.

Well," says Moishe, "I can't keep secrets."

### #119 The most famous person

Moishe got a new job with a firm of Accountants. One afternoon in the second week, he entered Martin Lewis’s office and declared: "Boss, I know everybody in the world."

Obviously, Martin didn't believe him and replied, "Everybody in the whole world?" Moishe said, "Yes sir, and you can choose anyone, and I will prove it." After a moment, Martin said, "I bet you don't know Madonna."   Moishe said, "I talk to her very often by e-mail, and what's more we've had dinner together. Now we are friends."

Martin decided to uncover the ruse, so he bought 2 tickets to Hollywood and they went to Madonna's house. Madonna personally opened the door. She opened her arms and said, "Oh Moishe, what a surprise! Come in, you and your friend." They spent a very nice afternoon there.  But Martin wasn't convinced. He thought that it could just have been a coincidence, so he said, "How about President Bush?" "George!" said Moishe. "Of course. We were friends together when I lived in USA. We always talked by phone."

Martin almost lost his cool and decided that this one he had to see immediately. They flew to Washington and as soon as they landed took a cab to the White House. There they went to see a press conference where Bush was making a speech. At the end, Bush happened to take a look in Moishe's direction. Moishe shouted, "George! George!" and Bush, with a smile, shouted back: "Moishe, buddy, come on in and let's have a talk."

Martin was bewildered – he couldn't believe it. But his mind didn't stop working. The chances that Moishe knew everybody in the world were billions to one. He decided to use a final test: The Pope. Moishe couldn't know the Pope. But Moishe said he knew the Pope when he lived in Poland. So they flew to the Vatican. There, in the middle of thousands of people, the Pope interrupted his prayer. They could see his lips saying "Moishe" with a smile in his face. The Pope opened his arms and called Moishe to come close to him by the veranda. Moishe was there, looking for Martin and he saw the exact moment when Martin fainted. The Pope blessed Moishe, Moishe kissed the Pope's staff and ran to where Martin was lying.

When Martin woke up, Moishe asked what had happened. Martin, sweating and still confused, looked at Moishe and finally said: "I have accepted Madonna, I have accepted Bush. Even the Pope I have accepted! But I couldn't stand it anymore when here, in the middle of the crowd, a random person asked me "Who is this guy dressed all in white, by the veranda, close to Moishe?"

### #120 The designer

Bernie decided he wanted to be an aeronautical engineer and build airplanes. He studied hard, went to the best schools, and finally got his degree. It didn't take long before he gained a reputation as the finest aeronautical engineer in all the land, so he decided to start his own company to build jets.

His company was such a hit that the President of Israel called Bernie into his office. "I want to commission your company to build an advanced Israeli jet fighter.

Needless to say, Bernie was tremendously excited at this prospect. The entire resources of his company went into building the most advanced jet fighter in history. Everything looked terrific on paper, but when they held the first test flight of the new jet, disaster struck. The wings couldn't take the strain--they broke clean off of the fuselage! (The test pilot parachuted to safety, thank God.)

Bernie was devastated; his company redesigned the jet fighter, but the same thing happened at the next test flight--the wings broke off. Very worried, Bernie went to his shul to pray, to ask God where he had gone wrong. The rabbi saw Bernie's sadness, and asked him what was wrong. Bernie decided to pour his heart out to the rabbi. After hearing the problem, the rabbi put his hand on Bernie's shoulder and told him, "Listen, I know how to solve your problem. All you have to do is drill a row of holes directly above and below where the wing meets the fuselage. If you do this, I absolutely guarantee the wings won't fall off."

Bernie smiled and thanked the rabbi for his advice...but the more he thought about it, the more he realised he had nothing to lose. So Bernie did exactly what the rabbi told him to do. On the next design of the jet fighter, they drilled a row of holes directly above and below where the wings met the fuselage. And it worked! The next test flight went perfectly!

Brimming with joy, Bernie went to tell the rabbi that his advice had worked. "Naturally," said the rabbi, "I never doubted it would." "But Rabbi, how did you know that drilling the holes would prevent the wings from falling off?"

"Bernie," the rabbi intoned, "I'm an old man. I've lived for many, many years and I've celebrated Passover many, many times. And in all those years, not once--NOT ONCE--has the matzah broken on the perforation!"

### #121 The slalom

As you may know, in a slalom race the skier must pass through about 20 "gates" in as little time as possible. Well, it happened that Israel had the fastest slalom-skier in the world, and the country had great expectations for an Olympic gold medal.

The day of the final came, and the crowd waited in anticipation. The French champion sped down the course in 38 seconds. The Swiss was clocked at 38.7 seconds, the German at 37.8 seconds, and the Italian at 38.1 seconds. Then came the turn of the Israeli. The crowd waited, and waited...SIX MINUTES!

"What happened to you?" screamed his trainer when the Israeli finally arrived. Replied the exhausted Israeli: "Which of those bastards fixed a mezuzah to each gate?"

### #122 The Indian holiday

Becky, an elderly Jewish lady from London, goes to her travel agent and says, "I want to go to India."

"Why India? It's filthy, very hot, and it's filled to the brim with Indians. It's a long journey, and those trains, how will you manage? What will you eat? The food is too hot and spicy for you. You can't drink the water. You must not eat fresh fruit and vegetables. You'll get sick - hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, malaria, God only knows. What will you do? Can you imagine the hospital, no Jewish doctors? Why torture yourself?"

"I want to go to India."

The necessary arrangements are made, and off she goes. Becky arrives in India and, undeterred by the noise, smell and crowds, makes her way to an ashram. There she joins the seemingly never- ending queue of people waiting for an audience with the guru. An aide tells her that it will take at least three days of standing in line to see the guru.

"That's okay."

Eventually Becky reaches the hallowed portals. There she is told firmly that she can only say three words. She is ushered into the inner sanctum where the wise guru is seated, ready to bestow spiritual blessings upon eager initiates. Just before she reaches the holy of holies, Becky is once again reminded, "Remember, just three words."

Unlike the other devotees, she does not prostate at his feet. She stands directly in front of him, crosses her arms over her chest, fixes her gaze on his, and says: "Sidney, come home."

### #123 The confession

Hymie enters a Catholic church and confronts the priest. "I am 93 years old. My wife is 91. We have been happily married for 64 years. Last week I had crazy, joyous sex with a 27-year-old super-model."

The priest is aghast. "Why don't you go to confession, old man?"

Hymie replies, "Why should a Jewish man such as myself go to confession?"

The priest is confused. "If you're Jewish, why then are you telling me this story?"

Hymie replies, "I'm telling everyone!"

Maurice was a good, well-respected elderly Edgware man. He felt that death was close and asked his sons to take him to the Holy Land, to die there and be buried in Jerusalem.

The loving sons did as he asked, brought him to Jerusalem, put him in a hospital and waited for death to come. However, once in Jerusalem Maurice started to feel better and better and after a few weeks was again strong, healthy and full of life.

He called upon his sons and said: "Quickly, take me back to Edgware."

The sons were somehow disappointed and asked: "Father, how come? You said you want to die in the Holy Land and be buried in Jerusalem!'

"Yes," answered Maurice, to die it's OK but to live here....!?"

David has done well for himself and is Mayor of a small town in Israel.

One day, David and his wife Andrea are walking past a construction site. Suddenly, one of the construction workers stops and calls out

"What's new, Andrea?"

"Why, it's nice to see you again Avi," Andrea replies. She turns to introduce David to the construction worker, and they speak for several minutes.

After David and Andrea continue on, he turns to her and asks how she knows Avi.

"Oh," Andrea said. "We went to the same high school. I even thought about marrying him."

David began to laugh. "You don't realise how lucky you are. If I hadn't come along, today you would be the wife of a construction worker!"

Andrea replied without hesitation, "Not really. If I had married him, he'd now be a Mayor!"

More time passes and Sam finds another girl, but this time he is sure that he has solved the problem because the girl's name is Goldberg. "Goldberg," exclaims his father, "this makes me very happy because it's a real good Jewish name, and from a good established family."

Then his father asks, "Is her first name one of my favourite names, like Rachael, or Rebecca?"

### #131 Tickets, anyone?

Yitzhak and Freda go out to see Fiddler on the Roof on stage. This is the most sold out show of the year.

Somehow, they've been lucky and manage to get best seats in the front row. But they notice that there's an empty seat in the row behind them. When intermission comes and no one has sat in that seat, Freda turns to the woman sitting next to the empty seat and asks, "Pardon me, but as this is such a sold out show and in such demand, we were wondering why that seat is empty."

The woman says, "That's my late husband's seat."

Freda is horrified and apologises for being so insensitive. But a few minutes later, she turns around again.

"Without meaning to be rude or anything, this is an incredibly hard show to get into. Surely you must have a friend or a relative who would have wanted to come and see the show?"

The woman nods, but explains, "They're all at the shiva."

### #132 The Jewish Olympics

If you read through the list of the events taking place at the next Maccabiah Games, you will notice that the Maccabiah Committee has made some changes. Some of the less-publicised events of particular interest to the world's Jewish communities, include: -

(1)Oyga Vault: A sound-enhanced Pole Vault competition. The vaulter must clear the bar then yell "Oy" upon hitting the foam pad below. Any heights cleared without an "Oy" will be considered a fault. Points will be added for more enthusiastic exclamations of "Oy," such as "Oy vay iz mir!", "Oy, I've just landed on my shana punim!" or, the winner in the Olympic trials', "Oy, such tsuris this is causing me!"

(2)Synchronized Swimming: Taking place in an Olympic sized mikvah, this event is sure to make a splash. But what do these young ladies do once their act has finished?

(3)Synchronized Tanning: Following the Synchronized Swimming portion, swimmers will have ten minutes to sunbathe. Their routine must include at least two rollovers as well as application of sunscreen to the ears and nose. An SPF of 15 is the required minimum. Judges will award additional points to those able to tan with a higher SPF number. Points will be deducted for burns, blotches, and bikinis.

(4)Team Handball: The goal here is simple: to create the ideal matzah ball. Each team will cook a two litre bowl of matzah ball soup, from scratch. The three winning batches will be fed to the athletes recovering in the infirmary. The toughest matzah balls will be used in the shot put competition.

(5)Triathlon: This year's Triathlon will involve one pound of shnitzel and a serving of tsimmes. The athlete must cook the shnitzel and tsimmes (first part), say a bruchah before eating this kosher meal (second part), and then run a marathon (third part). If the contender forgets to say the bruchah, he/she will be disqualified, but will still be required to run the marathon.

(6)Bagel Toss: A kosher version of horseshoes, the winner is he/she that first lands a bagel on each of the seven branches of the chanukiah.

(7)Balance Beam: The accountant or bookkeeper that balances the Chairman’s wife’s bank account in the shortest amount of time will be declared winner.

(8)Moyl Marathon: Each certified moyl must run a marathon and perform a bris at each kilometer mark. This is the only event that allows alcohol - for the babies of course.

(9)Rings: No longer part of men's gymnastics, this event now caters to newlyweds eager to show off the diamond rocks on their fourth fingers. The diamonds will be judged based on the "three C's," colour, clarity, and cut. Contestants will be judged based on the "three S's," smile, sophistication, and simchas.

### #133 The Jewish dog

Nathan walks into his shul with a dog.

The shammas comes up to him and says, "Pardon me, this is a House of Worship, you can't bring your dog in here."

"What do you mean," says Nathan, "this is a Jewish dog. Look."

And the shammas looks carefully and sees that this dog has a tallis bag round its neck.

Sammy," says the man, "daven!".

"Woof!" says the dog, stands on his hind legs, opens the tallis bag, takes out a kipa and puts it on his head.

"Woof!" says the dog, stands on his hind legs, opens the tallis bag, takes out a tallis and puts it round his neck.

"Woof!" says the dog, stands on his hind legs, opens the tallis bag, takes out a siddur and starts to daven.

"That's fantastic," says the shammas, "absolutely amazing, incredible! You should take him to Hollywood, get him on television, get him in the movies, he could make a million pounds!!"

"You speak to him," says Nathan, "he wants to be a marketing manager."

### #134 The big squeeze

The local pub was so sure that its barman was the strongest man around that they offered a standing £1,000 bet. The barman would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass and then hand the lemon to a customer. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many people had tried over time (weight lifters, rowers, wrestlers, etc.) but nobody could do it.

One day Hyman, a scrawny little man, came into the bar wearing thick glasses and a cheap jacket.

Hyman went up to the barman and said in a squeaky voice, "I'd like to try the bet"

After the laughter had died down, the barman said OK, grabbed a lemon and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to Hyman. But the laughter turned to silence as Hyman clenched his fist around the lemon and four more drops fell into the glass.

As the crowd cheered, the barman paid the £1,000 and asked, "What do you do for a living? Are you a professional strong man, or what?"

Hyman replied, "No. I’m not, I work for the Jewish National Fund."

### #135 Flying High

Yossi and Janine, an elderly Jewish couple, are sitting together on an aeroplane flying to the Far East. Suddenly, over the public address system, the Captain announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am afraid I have some very bad news. Our engines have ceased functioning, and this plane will be going down in a few minutes time. The good news is that I can see an island below us that should be able to accommodate our landing. The bad news is that this island appears to be uncharted - I am unable to find it on our maps. So the odds are that we will never be rescued and will have to live on the island for a very long time, if not for the rest of our lives."

Yossi turns to Janine and asks, "Janine, dear, did we turn off the oven?" and Janine replies, "Of course."

"Janine, are our life insurance policies paid up?"

"Of course."

"Janine, did we pay our pledge  for the Kol Nidre appeal?"

"Oh my God, I forgot to send off the cheque."

"Thank Heaven! They'll find us for sure!!"

### #138 The rowing crew

Yeshiva University in Golders Green decided to put together a rowing team.

Unfortunately, they lost race after race. They practised for hours every day, but never managed to come in any better than dead last. The Head of the Yeshiva finally decided he couldn't stand any more embarrassment so he sent Yankel to spy on the Oxford University team.

So Yankel shlepped off to Oxford and hid in the bullrushes off the river  from where he carefully watched the Oxford team as they practised.

Yankel finally returned to the Yeshiva.

"I have figured out their secret," he announced.

"They have eight guys rowing and only one guy shouting."

### #140 Madame Sadie

For months, Leah had been nagging her husband to go with her to the seance parlour of Madame Sadie.

"Cyril, Madame Sadie is a real gypsy and she brings the voices of the dead from the other world. We all talk to them. Last week, I talked with my mother, may she rest in peace. Cyril, for only £30 you can talk to your zaida who you miss so much."

Cyril could not resist and at the next seance, there was Cyril sitting under the coloured light at the green table, holding hands with the person on each side of him. All were humming.

Madame Sadie, her eyes lost in trance, was making passes over a crystal ball. "My medium Vashtri, who is that with you? Mr Himmelfarb? Cyril's zaida?"

Cyril swallowed the lump in his throat and called, "Grandpa? zaida?"

"Ah, Cyril?" a thin voice quavered.

"Yes, yes," cried Cyril, "this is your Cyril, zaida, are you happy in the other world?"

"Cyril, I am in bliss. I'm with your bubba. We laugh, we sing, we gaze upon the shining face of the Lord."

Cyril asks his zaida many questions and his zaida answers each, until -

"So now, Cyril, I have to go. The angels are calling. Just one more question I can answer. Ask. Ask."

"Zaida," sighed Cyril, "when did you learn to speak English?"

### #141 Sir Chicken Matthews

A Sunday League Jewish football team is desperate for players. So desperate in fact that one Sunday they are forced to play a kosher chicken in their team.

Rather surprisingly, the chicken has a brilliant first half. One minute it's clearing off its own line, the next its threading the perfect through ball, the next putting in a perfect cross.

At half time all its team-mates are very pleased and everyone runs back onto the pitch for the second half. On the way back, the referee starts chatting with the chicken.

"Great first half mate, you must be really fit".

"Thanks," said the chicken, "I try to keep myself fit but its difficult finding the time so I try to do an hour in the gym each morning before work".

"What do you do then?" asked the referee.

"I'm a chartered accountant" replies the chicken. At which point the referee immediately brandishes the red card and sends the chicken off. The concerned team-mates gather round the ref. and start complaining.

"Sorry lads", says the ref.,...... "I had no choice - Professional Fowl"

Soon afterwards, a letter of thanks came from their mother.

“David, the house you built is so huge. I live only in one room, but I have to clean the whole house. Henry, I am too old to travel. I stay most of the time at home, so I rarely use the Lexus. And that driver has shpilkas--he's a pain in the tuchas. But Alan, the chicken was delicious.”

The Genie looked at the map and exclaimed, "Are you crazy??? These people have been at war for years! I'm good, but I'm not that good. I don't think it can be done. So make another wish."

Tony thought for a minute and said, "You know, for some minor reason, a lot of people are beginning not to trust me. It would be terrific if you would make everyone trust me more. That's my wish."

The Hebrew people were sitting around Mt. Sinai. You could hear only a subdued murmur among them, but you could feel the tension in the air. For hours now, Moses had been on top of the mountain, hidden from their gaze by clouds wafting around its top. Sometimes the clouds became dark and you could hear thunder rolling down. In spite of the warm weather this always caused a shudder among the waiting mass.

The end of day was approaching and dusk was beginning to set in when suddenly a figure came through the clouds and walked down the steep mountainside carrying a heavy load. It was Moses.

Moses set down his load and raised his hands. "Friends," he said, "friends, it was hard work and I have done my best. I have negotiated with Him. I used every possible argument, every trick I could think of--and I think I was successful. The good news is: I brought him down from fifteen to ten. The bad news is: Adultery is still in."

### #167 Sabbath Violator.

Morris and Lenny are strolling home from shul one Saturday morning. Suddenly a cab speeds past, and their friend, Irving, is running frantically behind it, flailing his arms wildly.

"Well," said Lenny, "I never imagined our good friend Irving was a Sabbath violator! Look at him running for that taxi."

### #169 A Jewish Mother's Letter.

Dear Darling Son and That Person You Married,

I hope you are well. Please don't worry about me. I'm just fine considering I can't breathe or eat. The important thing is that you have a nice holiday, thousands of miles away from your ailing mother. I've sent along my last ten pounds in this card, which I hope you'll spend on my grandchildren. God knows their mother never buys them anything nice. They look so thin in their pictures, poor babies.

Thank you so much for the birthday flowers, dear boy. I put them in the freezer so they'll stay fresh for my grave. Which reminds me -- we buried Grandma last week. I know she died years ago, but I got to yearning for a good funeral, so Aunt Minnie and I dug her up and had the services all over again. I would have invited you, but I know that woman you live with would have never let you come. I bet she's never even watched that videotape of my haemorrhoid surgery, has she?

Well son, it's time for me to crawl off to bed now. I lost my cane beating off muggers last week, but don't you worry about me. I'm also getting used to the cold since they turned my heat off and am grateful because the frost on my bed numbs the constant pain. Now don't you even think about sending any more money, because I know you need it for those expensive family holidays you take every year. Give my love to my darling grand-babies and my regards to whatever-her-name-is -- the one with the black roots who stole you screaming from my bosom.

Love, Mum

### #177 God’s Email!

One day God was looking down at Earth and saw all of the evil that was going on. He decided to send an angel down to Earth to check it out.

When the angel returned, he told God that it was indeed bad on Earth. He reported that 95% was bad and 5% was good.

God thought a moment and decided He had better send down a female angel to get both points of view.

When the female angel returned she confirmed that Earth was in decline, 95% was bad and 5% was good.

God thought about what He could do about the situation and decided to e-mail the 5% that were good with a little pep-talk, some praise, something to encourage them, something to help keep them going.

Do you know what the e-mail said?....

Six month’s later, he's back in shul and the Gabbaim call him up again. This time Moshe picks up the Sefer like it was made of feathers, and flips it in the air. While the Torah is spinning, Moshe does a somersault and gets on his feet just in time to catch the falling Torah. He then turns to the Gabbaim and says, "What do you think of that, then?"

The Gabbai replies, "Very nice, but we gave you Shishi."

### #192 Bad Attitude Parrot

David received a parrot for his birthday. This parrot was fully grown, with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary. Every other word was a swear word. Those that weren't were, to say the least, rude. David tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft Israeli dance music, anything that came to mind. Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird, but the bird got worse. He shook the bird and the bird got madder and ruder.

Finally, in a moment of desperation, David put the parrot in the freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking and screaming and then, suddenly, all was quiet. David was frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.

The parrot calmly stepped out onto David's extended arm and said, "I'm sorry that I offended you with my language and actions. I ask for your forgiveness. I will go to synagogue with you every week to pray and I will try to modify my behaviour."

David was astounded at the bird's change in attitude and was about to ask what changed him when the parrot continued, "May I ask what the chicken did?"

### #193 The Donations

Kol Nidre was fast approaching and the Rabbi remembered his dissatisfaction with the donations given by his congregation last year. He wasn't confident that he could get more from them this year. The synagogue Treasurer suggested to him that perhaps he might be able to hypnotize the congregation into giving more.

"And just how would I go about doing that?" he asked.

"It is very simple. First you ensure all windows are shut so that the shul is warmer than usual. Then you give your usual sermon, but in a monotone voice. Meanwhile, you dangle a watch on a chain and swing it in a slow arc backwards and forwards and suggest to the congregation that they pledge 10 times more than they did last year."

So on Kol Nidre night, the Rabbi did as suggested, and lo and behold, they pledged 10 times more than normal.

Now, the Rabbi did not want to take advantage of this technique each and every year so he waited 2 years before trying mass hypnosis again.

Just as the last of the congregation was becoming mesmerised, the chain on the watch broke and the watch hit the floor with a loud thud and springs and parts flew everywhere.

"Crap!" exclaimed the Rabbi.

It took them a week to clean up the synagogue.

### #194 The dinner date

Shlomo and Yetta were getting ready to go out to dinner.

Yetta comes out of the bedroom and says to Shlomo, “Darling, do you want me to wear this Chanel suit or shall I put on the Gucci outfit?”

“What do I care?” Shlomo replies.

Yetta then asks, “Darling, shall I wear my Rolex or my Cartier watch?”

“Who gives a damn?” says Shlomo.

Yetta then says to Shlomo “Darling, shall I wear my 5 carat pear or my 6 carat round diamond?”

To which Shlomo responds “Hey, if you don’t get your act together, and soon, we are going to miss the Early Bird Special!”

### #195 The convert

Abe and Shlomo are strolling down the street one day when they happen to walk by a Catholic Church. They see a big sign posted that says: - ‘CONVERT TO CATHOLICISM AND GET £20.’

Abe stops walking and stares at the sign.

Shlomo turns to him and says, “Abe, what’s going on?”

“Shlomo,” replies Abe, “I’m thinking of doing it.”

Shlomo says, “What, are you crazy?”

Abe thinks for a minute and says, “Shlomo, I’m going to do it.”

With that, Abe strides purposely into the church and comes out 20 minutes later with his head bowed.

“So,” asks Shlomo, “did you get your £20?”

Abe looks up at him and says, “Is that all you people think of?”

### #196 The tourist

A Swiss tourist in Tel Aviv is looking for directions and pulls up at a bus stop where two Israelis are waiting.

”Entschuldigung Sie Bitte, koennen Sie Deutsch sprechen?” he says.

The two Israelis just stare at him.

“Excusey-moi, parlez vous Francais?”

The two continue to stare.

“Parlare Italiano?”

No response.

“Hablan ustedes Espanol?”

Still nothing.

The Swiss tourist drives off, extremely disgusted and frustrated. The first Israeli turns to his friend and says, “You know, maybe we should learn a foreign language…”

“Why?” says his friend, “that bloke knew four languages and that didn’t do him any good!”

### #197 Differences between Jewish Men and Women.

• Women have more imagination than men. They need it to tell men how wonderful they are.

• Women have a number of faults. Men have only two - everything they say and everything they do.

• A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.

• Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate during the night.

• When women are depressed they either eat or go shopping. When men are depressed, they invade another country.

• A man is a person who will pay £2 for a £1 item he wants. A woman, however, will pay £1 for a £2 item that she doesn't want.

• Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Dogs are a man's best friend. Now you know which sex is smarter.

• It's not true that men prefer foolish women. Rather they prefer women who can pretend to be foolish whenever necessary, which is the very core of intelligence.

• Men always want to be a woman's first love. Women have a more subtle instinct: What they like is to be a man's last romance.

• To be happy with a man, a woman must understand him a lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman, a man must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.

• A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change and she does.

• Men marry because they are tired; women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.

• A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband, while a man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.

• A woman will always cherish the memory of the man who wanted to marry her; a man will always cherish the memory of the woman who he didn't.

• There are two times when a man doesn't understand a woman - before marriage and after marriage.

• Only two things are necessary for a man to do to keep his wife happy. One is to let her think she is having her own way, and the other is to let her have it.

• Married men live longer than single men, but married men are a lot more willing to die.

• Any married man should forget his mistakes – it’s no use two people remembering the same thing.

• Some husbands are living proof that a woman can take a joke.

• Husbands are like cars: all are good the first year.

• A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.

• Men are like animals, but they make great pets.

### #198 Commitment

Most men fantasize in having a relationship with many beautiful women at the same time. For a man, commitment to a woman means giving up his fantasy.

Most women fantasize in having a relationship with one man who can provide economic security. For a woman, commitment to a man means achieving her fantasy.

Conclusion:  commitment means that a woman achieves her fantasy, while a man gives his up.

### #199 The Saucer

Roberto is an art connoisseur and one day notices a mangy little kitten lapping up milk from a saucer in front of a delicatessen in Tel Aviv. He quickly realises with a shock that the saucer was a very rare and precious piece of pottery. He strolled into the store and offered £2 for the cat.

"It's not for sale," said Abe, the proprietor.

"Look," said Roberto, "that cat is dirty and undesirable, but I'm eccentric. I like cats that way. I'll raise my offer to £10."

"It's a deal," said Abe, and pocketed the money.

"For that sum I'm sure you won't mind throwing in the saucer," said Roberto. "The kitten seems so happy drinking from it."

"Nothing doing," said Abe firmly. "That's my lucky saucer. From that saucer, so far this week, I've sold 34 cats."

### #200 Competition

Shlomo, driving a Yugo in Tel Aviv, pulls up at a stoplight next to a Rolls-Royce, rolls down his window, and smiles at the driver of the Rolls, "Hey, buddy, that's a nice car. Have you got a phone in it? I've got one in my Yugo!"

David, the driver of Rolls looks over and says simply, "Yes, I have a phone."

"Cool!" continues Shlomo. "Have you got a fridge in there, too? I got a fridge in the back seat of my Yugo!"

David, looking annoyed, says, "Yes, I have a refrigerator."

Shlomo goes on, "That's great! Listen, have you got a TV in there? I got a one right next to me."

David, looking very annoyed by now, says, "Of course I have a television. A Rolls-Royce is the finest luxury car in the world!"

"Say," persists Shlomo, "Have you got a bed in your car? I got one in the back of my Yugo!"

Upset that he hadn’t, David immediately drove off straight to his dealer and demanded that a bed be installed in the back of the car. The next morning David picked up his car, with a superb bed in it, a bed fit for a Rolls Royce...

David immediately went searching for the Yugo, and only late in the afternoon he found it parked, with all its windows fogged up from the inside.

He knocked on the Yugo, and finally Shlomo stuck his head out, soaking wet.

"I now have a bed in the back of my Rolls-Royce," David stated arrogantly.

"Jesus!" complained Shlomo, "You got me out of the shower to tell me this?"

### #201 Name change

Abe was one of the best talent spotters in the USA. One day, a young fellow walks into Abe’s office and says he wants to break into show-biz, so Abe says "Okay kid, show me what you do." The kid tells some jokes, does a little soft shoe shuffle, sings a bit, does an acrobatic act and is good enough to impress Abe.

"Great kid! Just great!," says Abe. "I can do things for ya! I think I can get you a show on T.V." (This was the early sixties.) "By the way, what's your name?"

The young man, proud and excited, exclaims "Penis Van Lesbian."

"'S’cuse me?," questions Abe.

"My name is Penis Van Lesbian" again replies the young man.

"Hey I'm sorry kid, you're gonna have to change your name, nobody is gonna hire you with a name like Penis Van Lesbian."

Well the young man is crestfallen but steadfastly refuses to change his name, so he leaves to find another agent.

A few months later he returns to Abe. "Hey kid! Good to see ya again" says Abe, "Are ya still looking for work? Have ya changed your name?"

With his head hanging low the young man replies "Yes. Every agent in town turned me down because of my name, Penis Van Lesbian. So I've changed it".

"Great kid, great! What's your new name?"

"Dick Van Dyke."

Abe takes his winnings and buys the best room in the hotel. He sits the frog down and says, "Frog, I don't know how to repay you. You've won me all this money and I am forever grateful."

"And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room."

### #206 The drinker

Ben Cohen had been drinking at a pub all night. The bartender finally said that the bar was closing. So Ben stood up to leave and fell flat on his face. He tried to stand one more time; same result. Ben figured he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that would sober him up.

Once outside, Ben stood up but fell flat on his face again. So he decided to crawl the 4 blocks to his home. When he arrived at the door, Ben stood up and again fell flat on his face. He crawled through the door and into his bedroom. When he reached his bed Ben tried one more time to stand up. This time he managed to pull himself upright, but he quickly fell right into bed and fell sound asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. He was awakened the next morning to his wife, Yente, standing over him, shouting, "So, you've been out drinking again!" "What makes you say that?" Ben asked, putting on an innocent look.

Yente replied "The pub called -- you left your wheelchair there again."

### #212 The special award

Maurice had worked most of his life helping his community and he was therefore thrilled one morning to hear that his unselfish work had been recognised by the Queen, no less. She had decided to bestow on Maurice a knighthood.

But his elation soon turned to dismay when he realised that his ceremony would take place on the first night of Pesach. “What on earth should I do”, thought Maurice, “should I attend ceder night with my loving family or should I accept one of the highest honours in the land? His family soon talked him into going to the Palace. “The award is too special to turn down and you would always live to regret it”, they told him.

His next worry was what to say to the Queen. He just couldn't think of anything that would be of interest to her. He just hoped that he would come up with something on the day.

Come the special day. There was Maurice, on his knees, being knighted, with the Queen touching his shoulders with her sword and Maurice shaking with excitement. All of a sudden, he burst out with “Ma Nishtona haleila hazeh”.

The Queen looked at Prince Philip with a surprised expression on her face and said to him “Why is this knight different from all other knights?”

### #213 Mind reader

My cousin Moishe owned one of the biggest and fastest-growing businesses in North West London, a furniture store.

I convinced him that he needed to take a trip to Italy to check out the merchandise himself and because he was still single, he could check out all the hot Italian women, and maybe get lucky.

As Moishe was checking into a hotel, he struck up an acquaintance with a beautiful young lady. She only spoke Italian and he only spoke English, so neither understood a word the other spoke.

He took out a pencil and a notebook and drew a picture of a taxi. She smiled, nodded her head and they went for a ride in the park. Later, he drew a picture of a table in a restaurant with a question mark and she nodded, so they went to dinner. After dinner he sketched two dancers and she was delighted. They went to several nightclubs, drank champagne, danced and had a glorious evening. It had gotten quite late when she motioned for the pencil and drew a picture of a four-poster bed.

Moishe was dumbfounded, and to this day remarks to me that he's never been able to understand how she knew he was in the furniture business.

Maurice Cohen says, "I covered my wife's body with schmaltz. We made love and she screamed for six hours. "The others say, "Six hours? How did you make her scream for six hours?" Maurice shrugs. "I wiped my hands on the drapes."

### #215 You can't hide the truth

Henry Goldberg invited his mother Freda over for dinner. During the course of the meal, Freda couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful Henry 's roommate, Debbie, was.

Freda had long been suspicious of a relationship between Henry and Debbie and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two react, Freda started to wonder if there was more between Henry and Debbie than met the eye. Reading his mum's thoughts, Henry said, "I know what you must be thinking, mum, but I assure you Debbie and I are just roommates."

About a week later, Debbie said to Henry "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" Henry replied "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure." So he sat down and wrote:

Dear Mother, I'm not saying that you "did" take the gravy ladle from the house, I'm not saying that you "did not" take the gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.

Several days later, Henry received a letter from his mother, which read:

Dear Son, I'm not saying that you "do" sleep with Debbie, and I'm not saying that you "do not" sleep with Debbie. But the fact remains that if she were sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.

Love Mum

I want to buy a piece of orange cloth. The length must be from the tip of your nose to the tip of your penis, and I want it delivered tomorrow."

Craig starts yelling and screaming at Abe. "Jew, what are you doing to me? I asked you for a piece of cloth from the end of your nose to the tip of your penis. Look at this place. What do you have to say for yourself?"

Abe replies, "The tip of my penis is in Poland."

### #222 Moishe the Cowboy

In the early 1800's, Moishe had to go to Omaha on business.

He went to the stagecoach office and asked, "How much ah teeket to Omaha?" The clerk responded, "five dollars". "Too much!" he complained. "Anyvay, I ain't got $5, I only got $2, so dere!". "Well you ain't goin ta Omaha for $2, so forget it!" said the clerk. "Liss'n, I got ta get ta Omaha. I got vely imput'n buiness dere. Pliess! Maybe you could do sumtink for me?" "I'll tell you what I can do," said the clerk. "We need somebody to ride shotgun. Gimme the $2 and you could ride shotgun." "Vutaya talkin' ride shotgun? I need ta ride on da stegecoych!" said Moishe.

"No, No! You don't understand!" said the clerk. "You ride up on the top with the driver. You hold this rifle and if you see any Indians, you shoot 'em."

"Vut you talkin' shoot Indians? I ain't never shot no Indians," replied Moishe.

"Listen to me! It's easy. You see an Indian; you point the gun at him and pull this trigger. Just give me the $2 and get up there with the driver," demanded the clerk.

So Moishe climbed up with the driver and off they rode into the prairie.

About 3 hours into the trip, the driver asked, "Ya see any Injuns?"

"Yep, I see vone." said Moishe. "How far away is he?" asked the driver. "How could I know dis?" asked Moishe, who then put his hand in front of the driver's face and held his thumb and forefinger about a half inch apart and said, "He looks dis big; should I shoot 'em?" "Not yet," said the driver. "You'll never hit him he's too far away. Wait 'til he gets closer." Another couple of hours passed and once again the driver asked, "Do ya still see the Injun?""Yep, I still see 'em." Again Moishe put his hand in front of the driver's face and this time held his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart and said, "He looks dis big, should I shoot 'em yet?" "Not yet," said the driver. "He's still too far away. Wait until he gets closer. I'll tell you when to shoot 'em."

Well, this same continued every few hours for several days. On the third day of their journey when asked if he still saw the Indian, Moishe demonstrated the size of the Indian by spreading his arms as far as he could from top to bottom, indicating that the Indian now looked very big. The driver said, "Okay, Now he's close enough. Now you can shoot 'em!"

Moishe hesitated and then said, "Nah, I couldn' shoot'em." "Whadya mean you cain't shoot 'em? Why not?" demanded the driver. Moishe put his hand in front of the driver's face and held his thumb and forefinger about a half inch apart, and said, "How could I shoot 'em? I've known him ince he was dis big!"

### #223 Quasimodo Levy - 1

Quasimodo Levy had finally decided to retire and the Abbott placed an advert in the Church gazette for a new bell ringer. One day a man with no arms came to the church to apply for the bell ringer's position. The Abbott, being an equal opportunity employer, said he would consider the armless man for the position if he could prove he could do the job. The armless man was led to the bell tower and when Quasimodo Levy asked him to do his stuff, the man got a running start and charged face-first into the bell. A beautiful melodious tone sang through the valley. So beautiful that all the townspeople came out of their houses crying, "who rang that bell - such a sound - hire him, hire him!"

Quasimodo Levy promptly asked him to ring the bell again. The man again took a running start but unfortunately slipped and plunged over the parapet to his death.

The townspeople were aghast and one called out, "who was that man?"

Quasimodo Levy replied, "I don't know but his face rings a bell."

---

### #224 Quasimodo Levy - 2

Unfortunately, this still left the church without a bell ringer. So the Abbott re-advertised the job. Another armless man showed up to apply for the position, claiming he was the dead man's brother and, having learned all he knew about bell ringing from his brother, declared that it was only right that he take over the bell ringer's position and succeed where his brother could not (due to his untimely death, naturally). The Abbott gave the brother the same chance to prove his ability. The brother charged at the bell smacking it with his face and eliciting a lovely mellow tone which was heard all throughout the valley. The townspeople came running into the square calling out "who rang that bell? Such tone, such vibrato - hire him, hire him!!”

Noting that it was nearing 3pm and time to ring the bell for real, Quasimodo Levy instructed the man to do the same. The man backed up to start his run and misjudged how close he was to the edge of the bell tower. He stepped backward and fell to his death.

The Abbott turned to Quasimodo Levy and asked, "who was that man?"

Replied Quasimodo Levy, "I don't know, but he's a dead ringer for his brother."

An Arab was walking through the Sahara desert, desperate for water, when he saw something, far off in the distance. Hoping to find water, he walked towards the image, only to find Hymie sitting at a card table with a bunch of ties laid out on it.

Hymie replied "I don't have any water, but why don't you buy a tie? Here's one that goes nicely with your robes."

The Arab replied, "I don't want a tie, I need water."

"OK, don't buy a tie. But to show you what a nice guy I am, I'll tell you that over that hill there, about 4 miles, is a nice restaurant. Walk that way, they'll give you all the water you want."

The Arab thanked him and walked away towards the hill and eventually disappeared. Three hours later the Arab came crawling back to where Hymie was sitting behind his card table.

Hymie said "I told you, about 4 miles over that hill. Couldn't you find it?"

The Arab rasped, "I found it all right. But they wouldn't let me in without a tie."

Moishe goes for a walk in the woods. Suddenly, a 6-foot-tall grizzly bear appears and

approaches him at quite a fast pace. Moishe stands there petrified and begins praying for his safety. But then Moishe notices that the bear has stopped, has put on a kippah, and has also began praying. Saved!

But as Moishe approaches the bear with an outstretched hand to greet a fellow Jew, he hears the bear conclude his prayer with, "Hamotze lechem min haaretz. Amen".

“So am I. How much land do you have?” asks Bud.

“Fifty meters in front, and almost a hundred at the back.”

Now it was the turn of Shlomo to ask a question.

“You’re from Texas, so what about your farm?" asks Shlomo.

Bud tells him, "On my farm, I can drive from morning until sundown and not reach the end of my property."

### #303 Life’s problems - 1

Maurice, Sam and Benny always met once a week in Edgware to discuss the world’s situation. On one occasion, they tried to solve the problem of life.

"What is the problem of life?" asked Benny.

The more they talked about it, the more they thought they knew the answer. The problem of life is that everyone has worries. “If people didn't have any worries,” said Sam, “then life would be easy.”

But now that they knew, another question remained, how can we three end our worries?

They thought for a while and then Maurice said, “Why don’t we hire somebody to do all the worrying for us so that we can then have it easy?”

Sam said, “Great idea. It wouldn’t be easy, I know, but between us, we could pay him well to make up for the difficulty of the role.”

So they all agreed to chip in to pay someone £600 a month to do all their worrying for them.

They were very happy with this decision until Sam pointed out the flaw.

"Tell me," he said, “If the man is making £600 each month, what has he got to worry about?”

Tell me, what are you praying to G-d for?" To this, the man replied, "I am telling G-d of my tsuris (troubles), of my financial problems, about my daughter who can't find a husband, and asking him to help me." "Well," the secular Jew asked, "does He send you help?" The man turned to him and said, "No, but what do you expect? It's like talking to a wall."

Moshe replies, “I did! But the roast beef caught fire and it spread to the vegetables so I had to put it out with the chicken soup.”

The orthodox Rabbi (who had a mischievous sense of humour) replied, “If you want to know the truth, I don’t really mind them sitting together at all. The trouble is, however, that I give sermons and I can’t have them sleeping together.”

Mrs Gold replied, “Thank you, Rabbi, but I am always thinking about the hereafter.”

Rabbi Herzl was rather surprised with this response.

“Really?” he said.

### #321 Preparing for a wedding

Benny Goldman had married off four of his children but the fifth was becoming a challenge. Young Solomon had no visible virtues that would make him a desirable husband. He had no charm, intelligence, manners, nor conversation to make up for his poor looks. Yet, to Benny, it was unthinkable that Solomon remained single.

In desperation, Benny met with a Jewish matchmaker who listened and said, "I have just the girl for Solomon -- Princess Anne’s daughter, Zara."

"Who?"

"Zara, granddaughter of the Queen of England, that’s who."

"A shikseh?"

The matchmaker sighed. "In these enlightened times, what's wrong with a nice Gentile girl? She comes from a good family, with very little anti-Semitism - they fought Hitler, remember. They have excellent social connections, they're wealthy and the princess is a real beauty. Look, I'll write the names down together."

Solomon Goldman  --- Princess Zara Phillips.

Benny thought the names looked very good together, but said, "I also have to consider aunt Bette. She is very religious and if she found out Solomon was marrying a shikseh, she'd kill herself."

So an appointment was made to see Bette.

For several hours, the matchmaker pleaded, argued, persuaded and slowly Bette began to change her mind. With tears in her eyes, Bette said, "Well, maybe you're right and I shouldn't be so old-fashioned. If the girl really is a fine girl, and if she will make Solomon happy, and if the children will be brought up Jewish, I won’t object. I can always move away from Edgware after the wedding and change my name so no one will know my shame."

Even though he was worn out, the matchmaker left Bette’s house in high spirits. As soon as he got into his car, he opened his little book to the page where both names had been written and put a tick after the name ‘Solomon Goldman’.

He then said, with a huge sigh of relief, "Half done!

### #322 The crime

A Stamford Hill policeman spots two youngsters riding a motorcycle.

They are unmistakably hassidic: yarmulke, payoth, tsittsits, the works.

He is unmistakably a bigot, so he follows them intending to catch them doing some kind of wrong.

After a long ride during which they went onto the North Circular Road and then onto many side roads, he could find nothing wrong with their driving. Frustrated, he stops them anyway.

"I have been following you two for a long time now, watching every move you made and hoping to catch you breaking the law, but you two seem to be perfect. How do you do it?"

They replied "HaShem is with us."

"That's it!" exclaimed the policeman, "Three people on a motorcycle!"

### #324 Drink up!

I had 12 bottles of whiskey in my cellar but I got into an argument with my wife and lost. She instructed me to empty each and every bottle down the drain, so I proceeded with the task.

I withdrew the cork from the first bottle and poured the contents down the sink, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I extracted the corks from the second and third bottles and did likewise, with the exception of one glass from each, which I drank.

I then pulled the cork from the fourth sink, poured the bottles down the glass, which I drank. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next, and drank one sink out of it and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out of the glass and poured the cork from the bottle. Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour.

When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the bottles, corks, glasses and sinks with the other, which were 29 and put the house in the bottle, which I drank.

I'm not under the affluence of incahol, but thinkle peep I am. I'm not half as thunk as you might drink. I fool so feelish I don't know who is me, and the drunker I stand here the longer I get!!!

### #325 My darling wife

"Why did you make her so good looking?"

"So you could love her, my son."

"Why did you make her such a good cook?"

"So you could love her, my son."

Sidney thought about this. Then he said, "I don't mean to seem ungrateful or anything, but why did you make her so stupid?"

"So she could love you, my son."

After about an hour of trying to remember, but to no avail, he got on the telephone and gave Hetty a call.

Embarrassed, he admitted that he didn't remember her answer to his proposal.

"Oh", Hetty said, "I'm so glad you called. I remembered saying 'yes' to someone, but I couldn't remember who it was."

"Sholom Aleichem, Mr. Goldstein. I'm collecting for the Loads of Money Yeshivah, and I'm wondering if a nice wealthy Jewish person like yourself wouldn't want to make a little contribution."

"The name is Gold, not Goldstein, and I am not Jewish."

"Are you sure?" asks Issy.

"I'm positive".

"But", says Issy, "it says here that you're Jewish and my records are never wrong."

"I can assure you that I am certainly not Jewish", replies Mr Gold impatiently.

"Look sir, I know that my records are never wrong. You must be joking. Are you sure you aren't Jewish?" demands Issy.

"For the last time, I am not Jewish, my father is not Jewish, and my grandfather, alav hashalom, wasn't Jewish either!"

Benny is almost 32 years old. All his friends are now married but Benny just dates and dates. Finally his friend asks him, "What's the matter, Benny? Are you looking for the perfect woman? Are you really that fussy? Surely you can find someone who suits you?"

"No I just can’t," Benny replies. "I meet many nice girls, but as soon as I bring them home to meet my parents, my mother doesn't like them. So I keep on looking!"

"Listen," his friend suggests, "why don't you find a girl who's just like your mother?"

Many weeks go by and again Benny and his friend get together.

"So, have you found the perfect girl yet? One that's just like your mother?"

Benny shrugs his shoulders, "Yes, I found one just like mum. Mum loved her right from the start and they have become good friends."

"So, do I owe you a Mazel Tov? Are you and this girl engaged yet?"

### #334 That’s the way to do it

One day, three men were hiking and unexpectedly came upon a large raging, violent river. They needed to get to the other side, but had no idea of how to do so.

The first man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength to cross this river." Poof! God gave him big arms and strong legs, and he was able to swim across the river in about two hours, but only after almost drowning a couple of times.

Seeing this, the second man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength ... and the tools to cross this river." Poof! God gave him a rowboat and he was able to row across the river in about an hour, but only after almost capsizing the boat a couple of times.

The third man had seen how this worked out for the other two, so he also prayed to God saying, "Please God, give me the strength and the tools...and the intelligence... to cross this river." And poof! God turned him into a woman. She looked at the map, hiked upstream a couple of hundred yards, then walked across the bridge.

### #335 Meyer’s first pet

MEYER, a lonely widower, was walking home along Golders Green Road one day, wishing something wonderful would happen to his life when he passed a Pet Store and heard a squawking voice shouting out in Yiddish:

"Quawwwwk...vus macht du...yeah, du...outside, standing like a putzel...eh?"

Meyer couldn't believe what he was hearing.  Suddenly, the proprietor came out of the shop and grabbed Meyer by the sleeve.  "Come in here and check out this parrot..."

Meyer was soon standing in front of an African Grey. The parrot cocked his little head and said:  "Vus?  Kenst reddin Yiddish?"

Meyer turned excitedly to the owner.  "He speaks Yiddish?"

"Vuh den?  Chinese maybe?"

In a matter of moments, Meyer had written out a cheque for £500 and carried the parrot, still in his cage, out of the shop and into his car. All night he talked with the parrot in Yiddish.  He told the parrot about his father's kosher butcher shop in Neasden; about how beautiful his mother was when she was a young bride; about his family in Israel; about his years of working in the City; and about Birchington, Kent.  The parrot listened and commented.  They shared some nuts and raisons.  The parrot told Meyer of what life was like living in the pet store and how he hated the weekends.  They then both went to sleep.

Next morning, Meyer began to put on his tfillin, all the while, saying his prayers.  The parrot demanded to know what he was doing, and when Meyer explained, the parrot wanted to do likewise.  So Meyer went out and bought a hand-made miniature set of tfillin for the parrot.  The parrot wanted to learn to daven and learned every prayer.  He wanted to learn to read Hebrew so Meyer spent weeks and months sitting and teaching the parrot, teaching him Torah. In time, Meyer came to love and count on the parrot as a friend and a Jew.  He had been saved.

One morning, on Rosh Hashanah, Meyer rose and got dressed and was about to leave when the parrot demanded to go with him.  Meyer explained that Shul was not place for a bird but the parrot made a terrific argument and was carried to Shul on Meyer's shoulder.

Needless to say, they made quite a spectacle and Meyer was questioned by everyone, including the Rabbi and Cantor.  At first they refused to allow a bird into the building on the High Holy Days, but Meyer convinced them to let him in this one time, swearing that the parrot could daven. Some bets were made with Meyer.  Thousands of pounds were bet that the parrot could NOT daven, could NOT speak Yiddish or Hebrew, etc. All eyes were on the African Grey during the service.  The parrot perched on Meyer's shoulder as one prayer and song passed - Meyer heard not a peep from the bird.  He began to become annoyed, slapping at his shoulder and mumbling under his breath, "Daven!"

Nothing.

"Daven...parrot, you can daven, so daven...come on, everybody's looking at you!"

Nothing.

After the Rosh Hashanah service was over, Meyer worked out that he owed over four thousand pounds.  He marched home, angry, saying nothing.  Finally several streets away from the Shul, the bird began to sing an old Yiddish song and was happy as could be.

Meyer stopped and looked at him.  "You miserable bird, you cost me over four thousand pounds.  Why?  After I bought you your own tfillin and taught you the morning prayers and taught you to read Hebrew and the Torah. And after you begged me to bring you to Shul on Rosh Hashanah, why? Why did you do this to me?"

"Don't be a schmuck," the parrot replied. "The odds will be much better on Yom Kippur."

---

### #336 Meyer’s second pet

Meyer’s parrot had died and he was lonely once again. He quickly decided that life would be more fun if he had another pet. So Meyer went back to the Golders Green pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy another pet, but this time a bit more unusual. After some discussion, he finally bought a talking centipede, which came in a little white box to use for his house.

Meyer took the box home. He found a good place to put it and decided he would immediately take his new pet to the local pub to have a drink and show it off. He asked the centipede in the box, "Would you like to go to The Leather Bottle with me and have a beer?"

But there was no answer from his new pet.  This bothered Meyer a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked his pet again, "How about going to The Leather Bottle and having a drink with me?"

But again, there was no answer from his new friend and pet.  So Meyer waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation.  He decided to ask one more time, this time putting his face up against the centipede's house and shouting, "Hey, you in there!  Would you like to go to The Leather Bottle and have a drink with me?"

A little voice came out of the box: "I heard you the first time!  I'm putting on my shoes."

### #337 The Rabbi and his friends - 1

A rabbi, a priest, and a minister are out fishing in the middle of a lake. The priest tells his two colleagues, "I left my fishing rod in the car; I'll be right back." He gets out of the boat, walks across the water to the beach, goes to the car, walks back across the lake, and gets into the boat. The rabbi stares at this in amazement.

30minutes later, the minister says, "I need to go to the toilet." He, too, gets out of the boat, walks across the water, finds the nearest men's room, walks back across the water and gets into the boat. The rabbi is absolutely dumbfounded!

The rabbi keeps thinking, "My faith is as great as theirs!" So he speaks up and says, "I need to get something to drink; there's a refreshment stand on the beach."

He stands up, puts his feet on the water, and SPLASH, he goes straight down under the water. The priest and minister help him back into the boat. He is embarrassed, not to mention wet, but he knows he can do it if the other two can. So, he stands up again, steps out onto the water, and again, SPLASH!! Again, he is dragged out and again he decides to try. As he is going down for the third time, the priest turns to the minister and asks, "Do you think we should show him where the rocks are?"

---

### #338 The Rabbi and his friends - 2

A rabbi, a priest, and a minister were talking one day. The priest told of an occasion when he was caught in a snowstorm so terrible that he couldn't see a foot in front of him. He was completely confused, unsure even of which direction he needed to walk. He prayed to God, and miraculously, while the storm continued for miles in every direction, he could clearly see his home 20 feet away.

The minister told a similar story. He had been out on a small boat when a heavy storm struck. There were 20-foot high waves, and the boat was sure to capsize. He prayed to God, and, while the storm continued all around, for several feet in each direction, the sea calmed, and the minister was able to return safely to port.

The rabbi, too, had such a story. One Shabos morning, on the way home from his Shul, he saw a very thick wad of £20 notes in the gutter. Of course, since it was Shabbat, the rabbi wasn't able to touch the money. So he prayed to God, and everywhere, for miles in every direction, it was still Shabbat, but for 10 feet around him, it was Thursday.

### #339 The Rabbi and his friends - 3

A rabbi, a priest, and a minister are discussing what they do with donations to their respective religious organizations. The minister says that he draws a circle on the floor, throws the money up in the air, and whatever lands in the circle, he gives to God, and whatever lands outside the circle, he keeps.

The priest uses a similar method. He draws the circle, but whatever lands outside the circle, he gives to God, and whatever lands inside, he keeps.

The rabbi has a slightly different method of dividing the money. He throws all the money up in the air. Whatever God wants, he keeps...

Then, when he comes home after a long, hard day at work, Solomon has to make dinner because she can't be bothered even with that!"

The neighbour sighs and asks, "Nu...and how is your daughter?"

"Oh, now my daughter Rivka has an absolute gem of a husband. He insists my Rivka pamper herself by sleeping late in the morning; he hired help so she shouldn't have to work so hard, and he even comes home from work and tells her to relax while he takes care of dinner!"

### #350 The test

The Recording Angel needed two new Executive Assistants to help him in the admissions office in Heaven. G-d sent him 3 applicants and the Angel began interviewing them immediately.

“I was senior partner in a law firm on earth,” said the first applicant “and I’m sure I could be very helpful to you.”

“I’m sure you could,” said the Angel. “I’ve looked over your CV and you certainly have more than enough credentials for the job. But I do have a little test I ask all applicants to take. Would you spell G-d, please?”

“A piece of cake,” said the applicant. “G - O - D.” “Fine,” said the Angel, extending his hand, “I’ll be in touch.” The fellow left and the second applicant came in.

“I was Chief Executive of a very successful business on earth,” he said. “There were 16,000 people on my payroll. I think I’d make an excellent assistant.”

“Your record is certainly impressive,” said the Angel. “And I think I’m going to hire you, but first there’s a little test. Spell G-d.”

“G - O - D” said the second applicant. “Great!” said the Angel, shaking his hand. “You’ll be hearing from me.”

The man left and the third applicant, a woman, approached the Angel’s desk. “Tell me about yourself,” said the Angel.

“On earth,” she said, “I was secretary to one of the most powerful men in Europe. You know, because you know everything, that I did most of the work for which he got credit. I’m certain I could do whatever is required.”

“Of course,” said the Angel, “but there’s one little test….”

“Oh, please, not a test” said the woman. “I’ve had it rough all my life. Because I’m a woman I had to fight for every promotion I ever got. I had to take lower pay for doing the same job as the men in the office. I was constantly harassed by male chauvinist bosses. I thought it would be different up here. Now I get the feeling that because the job title is Executive Assistant and not Secretary, you don’t want to give me a chance at it.”

No, no. Not at all!” said the Angel. “This is just a little test that I give all applicants, regardless of sex.”

“All right,” sighed the woman. “Go ahead.”

“Spell desuetude, parietals, and chiaroscuro,” said the Angel.

### #351 The lunch

Abbe Cohen goes to a restaurant every day for lunch. He always orders the soup du jour. One day the manager asks him how he liked his meal. Abbe replies (with Yiddish accent) "Wass goot, but you could give a little more bread."

The next day, the manager tells the waitress to give him four slices of bread. "How was your meal, sir?" the manager asks. "Wass goot, but you could give a little more bread".

Next day the manager tells the waitress to give him eight slices of bread. "How was your meal today, sir?" the manager asks. "Wass goot, but you could give a little more bread".

The manager is now obsessed with seeing Abbe say that he enjoyed his meal, so he goes to the bakery and orders a 6ft long French loaf. When Abbe comes in as usual the next day, the waitress and the manager cut the loaf in half, butter the entire length of each half and lay it out along the counter, right next to his bowl of soup. Abbe sits down, and devours both his bowl of soup and both halves of the 6ft loaf of bread. The manager now thinks he will get the answer he is looking for. When Abbe comes up to pay for his meal, the manager asks in the usual way: "How was your meal TODAY, sir?"

Abbe replies "It wass goot as usual but I see you are back to giving only 2 slices of bread!"

"I know which one she is." She says.

Rabbi Menzies is astonished and replies, "Don't you realise what you are asking? Today is Yom Kippur, when we fast and beg for forgiveness, and you come to me and tell me that want to drink and break your fast? Be strong and do not give in!"

Morry is in tears, "Please Rabbi, just a small drink. I can't take it anymore!"

But Rabbi Menzies is not an unkind man, and is touched by Morry’s suffering. He thinks for a while and says "Alright." He calls over the shammes, "give Morry a teaspoon of water."

The teaspoon of water is given to Morry who is now crazy with thirst.  "Please, please! I've got to have a real drink or I’ll die!" he cries.

A few days later, the two students met each other in the street. One had a pronounced limp and had dark circles under his eyes. He looked very tired and weary. On the other hand, the other was the same as he had been before.

### #378 The facelift - 1

Hette has a heart attack and is taken to hospital. While on the operating table she has a near death experience, during which she sees God and asks if this is the end for her.

God says no and explains that she has another 30-40 years to live.

As soon as she had recovered, Hette figured that since she's got another 30 or 40 years, she might as well stay in the hospital and have the face-lift, liposuction, breast augmentation and tummy tuck that she had always promised herself. So she did and she even changed the colour of her hair!

But tragedy - some weeks later, as Hette is leaving hospital, she is knocked over and killed by a car just as she left the hospital.

When Hette arrives in front of God, she asks, "I thought you said I had another 30-40 years?".

So he thought he would put this to the test. On his way home, he stops off at Brent Cross shopping centre. He first of all goes into Smiths, buys a newspaper and says to the girl behind the cash desk, "I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?"

"About 35," came the reply.

"I'm actually 47," Morris says, feeling really happy.

Then he goes into Fenwicks for lunch and asks the waitress the same question, to which the reply is, "Oh you look about 29 ".

"I am actually 47." This makes him feel really good.

In the car park on the way out, Morris meets two elderly ladies and asks them the same question. One of them winks to the other and replies, "I can’t really tell. I am 70 years old and my eyesight is not as good as it used to be. But when I was younger, there was a sure way of telling a man’s age. If you let me put my hand down your trousers for a few minutes, I will certainly be able to tell your exact age."

As there was no one around, Morris thought why not and let her slip her hand down his trousers. Five minutes later, the lady says, "OK, it's done. I now know that you are 47."

Stunned, Morris says to her, "That was brilliant. How did you do that? "

She replies, giggling, "We were behind you in the Fenwick’s queue."

"I'm lonely,” he said, "Because I've spent the past 20 years in prison."

"Why the moon, of course," replied the Rabbi after some pondering. "It shines at night, when it is needed. The sun, however, shines only during the day, when there is no need of it at all."

Hette said, "Well, then why are you crying?"

The old lady continued, "He makes me homemade soup for lunch and my favourite cake and then makes love to me for half the afternoon".

Hette asked again, "Well, why are you crying?"

The old lady continued, "For dinner he makes me a gourmet meal with wine and my favourite dessert and then makes love to me until 2 o’clock in the morning.

Hette asked yet again, "Well, why in the world would you be crying?"

The old lady replied, "I can't remember where I live!"

### #395 A conversation with God

God: And remember, Moses, in the laws of keeping Kosher, never cook a calf in its mother's milk. It is cruel.

Moses: “So you are saying we should never eat milk and meat together.”

God: “No, what I'm saying is, never cook a calf in its mother's milk.”

Moses: “Oh Lord, forgive my ignorance! What you are really saying is we should wait six hours after eating meat to eat milk so the two are not in our stomachs.”

God: “No, Moses, listen to me.  I am saying, don't cook a calf in its mother's milk!!!”

Moses: “Oh, Lord! Please don't strike me down for my stupidity! What you mean is we should have a separate set of dishes for milk and a separate set for meat and if we make a mistake we have to bury that dish outside....”

God: “Moses, do whatever you want..........”

Morris and Bernard met in a restaurant for a business lunch.

Morris said, "I have a good deal for you, Bernard. When I was in London Zoo recently, I happened to pick up an elephant they didn’t need any more. I could let you have it for three thousand pounds."

Bernard sipped his gin and tonic and said, "Morris, what am I going to do with an elephant? I live in a third floor flat. I barely have room for my furniture. I can't even squeeze in a card table. So you think I'm going to buy an elephant?"

Morris said, "I could let you have three of them for two grand."

"Aha," said Bernard, "now you're talking!"

"I'm not going to shul today!" he said to Sarah emphatically.

"No I'm not . . . I don't think I really want to ever go again!" Benjamin said with obvious irritation. "The people down there don't like me, they ignore me sometimes . . . they don't appreciate me at all . . . and I won't go back."

"Yes, you will go today, and you will continue", said Sarah with confidence. And, I'll give you two reasons. Number one, you're 45 years old ... and Number two, you're the Rabbi!"

"Very good, sir," says the furrier. "Today is Friday, you may come by on Tuesday to pick it up after the cheque has cleared."

So David and the woman leave.

On Tuesday, David returns to the shop, on his own. The furrier is outraged to see him.

Rabbi Bloom asked young Paul what his favourite bible story was.

"I guess the one about Noah and the ark, where they floated around on the water for 40 days and 40 nights" replied Paul.

Paul thought for a moment, then replied, "I don't think so...they only had two worms."

Hette tells St. Peter," I've been a good woman, I made Shabbos every Friday, I went to the synagogue on the holidays and took care of my family." St. Peter tells Hette to step to the right.

"Why, we gather them carefully and send them to the city and then they make bread of them again and send it to us."

"Ah. So what about candles after they are burnt? What do you do with the ends?"

"We send them to the city as well, and they make new candles from them and send them to us."

"And what about circumcision?   What do you do with those leftover pieces?"

The rabbi, wearily, replies, "We send them to the city as well."

"To the city? And when you do this, what do they send to you?"

"Today they have sent you to us."

### #409 Quick thinking

A minister, a priest and Rabbi Samuels went for a walk in the country. It was a very hot day. They were sweating and exhausted when they came upon a small lake. Since it was fairly secluded, they took off all their clothes and jumped in the water naked. When they came out, they were feeling so refreshed that the trio decided to pick a few berries while enjoying their "freedom."

But as they were crossing an open area, who should come along but a group of ladies from town. Unable to get to their clothes in time, the minister and the priest covered their privates and Rabbi Samuels covered his face.

After the ladies had left and the men had got their clothes back on, the minister and the priest asked Rabbi Samuels why he covered his face rather than his privates.

Rabbi Samuels replied, "I don't know about you, but in MY congregation, it’s my face they would recognize."

### #411 Groan, groan

Bernie and Yossi were down on their luck and decided to do some part time external decoration work to earn extra money. To start off their new venture, they asked their Rabbi if he would be interested in their painting the outside of his house - for a very keen price, obviously. The Rabbi said yes and so Bernie and Yossi went out to buy the paint.

They drove to the local Sainsbury’s Homebase store and bought some emulsion. It was cheap enough as paint goes and they planned to mix half paint and half water to further increase their profits. Then they went back to the Rabbi’s house and started work.

When they had finished painting the Rabbi’s house, Yossi called the Rabbi and his wife to come out and inspect their work.

"It looks wonderful," the Rabbi said. But as he started to hand them their cheque, it started to rain quite heavily. All at once there was thunder and lightning, the Rabbi’s house was drenched, and the paint started running down the walls.

Suddenly, as the three of them stood there in disbelief, a voice from heaven roared . . . "Repaint. Repaint and thin no more."

"Well what is it, Esther?"

"Well, my husband, passed away last night, Rabbi."

"Oh, Esther", said the Rabbi, "That's terrible. Tell me Esther, did he have any last requests?"

"Well, yes he did Rabbi," replied Esther.

"What did he ask, Esther?"

Esther replied, "He said, 'Please, please Esther, put down the gun...'

### #415 The visitor

A Martian runs into some turbulence over Earth and makes a rough landing in Golders Green. After he pulls himself out of his space ship and dusts himself off, he sees that one of his wheels is broken. Not far away are some shops, so he starts to walk towards them to see if he can find a replacement.

By good luck, he comes across a store with a sign showing a wheel, and a bunch of wheels in the window. He enters the store, gets the attention of Moishe behind the counter, and says, "Excuse me, I'd like to buy a wheel."

"Wheel?" says Moishe. "We don't have wheels here."

"Then what are those things in the window?"

"Oh, those aren't wheels. They're bagels."

"Gee, they look just like wheels. What do you use them for?"

"We eat them," says Moishe and he hands a bagel to the Martian.

The Martian takes a taste, chews thoughtfully, and lights up. "Hey," he says, "I bet these would go great with cream cheese and lox!"

The rabbi replies in a severe tone of voice: "Certainly not!"

The Rabbi immediately replies, with a warm smile, "Yes, of course!"

### #418 The tailor

Yossi goes to a tailor to try on a new custom-made suit. The first thing he notices is that the arms are too long.

"No problem," says the tailor.  "Just bend them at the elbow and hold them out in front of you.  See, now it's fine."

"But the collar is up around my ears!"

"It's nothing.  Just hunch your back up a little . . . no, a little more.   . . . that's it."

"But I'm stepping on my cuffs!"  Yossi cries in desperation.

"Nu, bend your knees a little to take up the slack.  There you go.  Look in the mirror -- the suit fits perfectly."

So, twisted like a pretzel, Yossi lurches out onto the street.  Janine and Suzy see him go by.

"Oh, look," says Janine, "that poor man!"

"Yes," says Suzy, "but what a beautiful suit!"

The officer comes up to the car and says to her, “Madam, did you know you were speeding?”

The policeman then says to Hette, “May I see your driving licence?”

Hette turns to Michael and asks him, “What did he say?”

Michael yells back at her, “He wants to see your driving licence.”

So Hette gives the officer her licence.

The policeman looks at the licence and then says, “Ah. I see you are both from Golders Green in London. I spent some time there many years ago and I’ll always remember the time that I went on a blind date with the ugliest woman I have ever seen in my life.”

Hette turns to Michael and asks him, “What did he say?”

Michael yells back at her, “He says he thinks he knows you.”

### #420 Honesty

One day, a poor woodcutter was cutting a branch of a tree above a river when his axe fell into the river. When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"

The woodcutter told him that he had dropped his axe into water.

God went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe.

"Is this your axe?", God asked. The woodcutter said "No".

God again went down and came up with a silver axe.

"Is this your axe?" God asked. The woodcutter said "No".

God went down again and came up with an iron axe. "Is this your axe?", God asked. The woodcutter said, "Yes".

God was so pleased with the man's honesty that he gave him all the three axes. The woodcutter went home happy.

Many months later, while the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the river, she fell into the river. When he began crying, God appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"

"My wife has fallen into the water and I can’t swim."

God went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. "Is this your wife?", God asked.

"Yes", he said.

God was furious, "YOOOOOU CHEEEEAT!! Now I am going to punish you."

The woodcutter quickly said, "Please forgive me, My Lord. It is a misunderstanding. If I said "No" to Jennifer Lopez, you would have come up with Joan Collins. If I also said "No" to her, you would have finally come up with my wife and I would say "Yes". Then you would give all the three women to me. I am a poor man. I would not be able to look after all three of them, so that's why I had to say "Yes"...

### #421 The curse

Shirley sat next to Hette, a middle aged lady, in shul one Shabbos. She couldn’t help but notice Hette’s wonderful, huge diamond ring on her wedding finger. Shirley sat there staring at it but couldn’t hold out any longer and said to Hette, “I hope you don’t mind me saying this but I just have to let you know that I think that your ring is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen.”

“Oy vay,” said Hette. “Thank you for saying that. This definitely is a beautiful diamond ring, but unfortunately, it has a curse as well.”

“What do you mean?” said Shirley.

Hette replied, “Don’t you know that this is the Katz diamond?”

Shirley replied, “The Katz diamond?”

“Yes, the Katz diamond, and the Katz diamond has a curse.”

“But what ever is this curse?” asked Shirley.

“Mr Katz.”

### #422 Share and share alike

Moishe was eating in Solly’s restaurant one day when he saw an elderly couple on another table. They had ordered one plate of salt beef and chips, one drink and one extra glass.

As he watched, the old man carefully divided the salt beef into 2 portions, then counted the chips and divided them equally as well. Then he poured half the drink into the extra glass and put it in front of his wife. The old man then began to eat and his wife just sat there watching, her hands folded in her lap.

Moishe had to ask them whether they would accept him buying them an extra meal so that they didn’t have to split theirs.

The old man said, “Oh, no, that’s very kind. We’ve been married 50 years now, and everything has always been and will always be shared 50/50.”

Moishe then asks the old lady why she wasn’t eating. She replied, “it’s his turn with the teeth.”

### #423 The change maker

Freda was looking very sad whilst talking to her best friend Kitty. "Ever since we got married, Robert has been trying to change me. That’s all he seems to do. He got me to stop drinking, cut down significantly on my smoking, and he stopped me going shopping at Brent Cross at all hours of the day. He taught me how to dress well, how to enjoy the fine arts, he got me to enjoy gourmet cooking, classical music and recently how to invest in the stock market. He even sent me to Hebrew Classes."

On hearing this, Kitty said, "Sounds like are just a little bitter because Robert spends so much time trying to change you."

"I'm not bitter, " said Freda. "Now that I'm so improved, I find he just isn't good enough for me any more."

### #424 Rodney Dangerfield lines:

### #426 The line up

The end of the world has come. God looks over the millions and millions of people and says to them, "Welcome to Heaven. I want the women to go with St. Peter. Go now and follow him. And you men, I want you to form two lines. The first line, to the left of me, is for men who dominated their women on earth. The second line, to the right of me, is for men who were dominated by their women." OK, now line up.

There was then much movement for some length of time, but eventually the women are gone and there are two lines of men. The line of the men that were dominated by their women is 150 miles long. The line of men that dominated women has only one man.

God is angry and says, "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image and yet you were all dominated by your mates. Look at the only one of my sons that stood up and made me proud. Learn from him!"

He turns to the man and says, "Tell them, my son. How did you manage to be the only one on that line?"

The man says, "I don't know, my wife told me to stand here."

### #427 Serves you right

Morris was manager of a local estate agents. One day, he hired a new secretary. She was so good looking and sexy that he decided he just had to try and go out with her, even though this meant he would be doing it behind his wife’s back. He was very surprised how successful he was in his new ‘venture’.

But within a few weeks, he was feeling very unhappy at the way she was working during the day. Her attitude was one of not caring, being rude to clients and coming in to work late. After two more weeks, Morris couldn’t let her behaviour continue and he asked her to come into his office for a little chat.

"Listen, Marlene, we may have gone to bed together a few times, but who told you that you could start coming into work late and slacking off?"

Marlene replies, "My lawyer!"

Moshe goes to see his Rabbi. “Rabbi, last week I missed saying grace after meals.”

“Why,” asked the Rabbi.

“Because I forgot to wash my hands before the meal.”

“That’s twice you’ve broken the law but you still haven’t told me why.”

“The food wasn’t kosher.”

“You ate non-kosher food?” asked the Rabbi.

“It wasn’t a Jewish restaurant.”

“That makes it even worse,” said the now angry Rabbi. “Couldn’t you have eaten in a kosher one?”

“What, on Yom Kippur?”

### #431 Holiday email

Moishe left the cold climate of Edgware and went on holiday to Florida. His wife Becky, who was in a Bridge competition, was planning to join him in Florida the next day.

When Moishe reached his hotel, he decided to send Becky a quick email to say he’d arrived and all was well. Unable to find the scrap of paper on which he had written the email address she had given him, he did his best to type it in from memory. Unfortunately, he missed one letter and his email was directed instead to an elderly woman whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving woman checked her email, she took one look at the screen, let out a piercing scream, fainted and fell to the floor with a thud. At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this email on the screen:

“Dearest Wife, just got checked in. Everything prepared for your arrival tomorrow.

Your Loving Husband

P.S. Sure is hot down here.”

### #432 The Wallet

A poor Jew finds a wallet with £700 in it. At his shul, he reads a notice stating that a wealthy Jew has lost his wallet and is offering a £50 reward to anyone who returns it. Quickly he locates the owner and gives him the wallet.

The rich man counts the money and says, "I see you have already taken your reward."

The poor man responds, "What are you talking about?"

The wealthy Jew continues, "This wallet had £750 in it when I lost it."

The two men begin arguing, and eventually they come before the Rabbi.

Both men present their case. The poor man first, then the wealthy man who concludes by saying, "Rabbi, I trust you believe me."

The Rabbi says, "Of course." The rich man smiles, and the poor man is devastated. Then the Rabbi takes the wallet out of the wealthy man's hands and gives it to the poor man who found it.

"What are you doing?" the rich man yells angrily.

The Rabbi responds, "You are, of course, an honest man, and if you say that your missing wallet had £750 in it, I'm sure it did. But if the man who found this wallet is a liar and a thief, he wouldn't have returned it at all. Which means that this wallet must belong to somebody else. If that man steps forward, he'll get the money. Otherwise, it stays with the man who found it."

"What about my money?" the rich man asks.

"Well, we'll just have to wait until somebody finds a wallet with £750 in it!"

### #433 Family of the devil

One Shabbos morning, during prayers, there was a loud BOOM and a sudden flash of smoke appeared in the front of the synagogue. When the smoke cleared, the astonished congregation saw this frightening figure in red, complete with horns, pitchfork and tail and a Jewish Yarmulke.

Immediately, the congregation panicked. People rushed to the back of the synagogue trying to get away. The devil watched the retreat with great glee, but his mood was disturbed by the sight of one man still relaxing comfortably in the third row right side in his pew.

Angrily the devil thundered, "Do you not know who I am?"

Morris replied in a nonchalant way, "Sure I do."

The devil was extremely puzzled. "Do you not fear me?"

"Nope! Not at all!" came the reply.

"Why not?"

Morris snorted, "What for? I’ve been married to your sister for 35 years!"

### #447 The Rolls Royce

Hette was a very successful businesswoman. In 2001, she had such a good year that she bought herself a Rolls Royce. But a couple of weeks later, she took it back to the dealer and complained that there were odd, wheezing noises coming from the front end of the car. The dealer had the car checked and telephoned Hette. ‘We can’t find anything wrong with the car, as we expected. There’s only one possible explanation,’ he said. ‘Your chauffeur must have asthma’.

### #448 The operation

Morris was a very uneducated man, but by ruthless means became very rich. The older Morris got, the richer he got, the richer he got, the more women he had, the more women he had, the less use he was to them.

One day, Morris went to the top surgeon in the business and said, “I want to be castrated.”

“You want to be WHAT?”

“I said castrated, my sexual powers are failing. I insist you operate at once.”

The surgeon was a bit dubious, but in view of this last statement, and for a fee of £2,000, he carried out the operation.

Some weeks later, Morris was drinking in his local pub, listening to the conversation at the next table.

“I say, Barney,” said one of the group, do you think there’s any truth to the rumour that if a man gets himself circumcised, it improves his sexual performance?”

Morris quickly left the pub muttering to himself “Circumcised, that was the word I’ve been trying to think of.”

### #449 What a meal!

Shlomo went on holiday to Spain. One day, he sat in a Spanish cafe on Fiesta Day and watched the waiter serve a fragrant and attractive dish to a party at the next table.

“What is that?” Shlomo asked.

“Senor, those are the bull’s testicles from today’s bullfights.”

“They look excellent! Bring me some.”

“Senor, there is a wait! People sign up one year in advance for such a delicacy.”

“Then sign me up! I’ll be here this time next year.”

A year of anticipation later and Fiesta Day arrives again. Shlomo is in the cafe anxiously awaiting his meal. Finally, the waiter appears with two leathery little lumps covered by gravy.

“And what is this?” cried Shlomo. “Look at them! Do you call this a meal for a Jew? Last year they were fragrant and big and fluffy! What happened?”

“Senor, the bull does not always lose.”

### #450 The confessions

The night before their wedding, Alf and Bette were sharing confidences.

Alf said,  “You must know something before we get married. I am a fanatic golfer. I eat, sleep and drink golf. Golf is my whole life. After we are married, I’ll try for some balance but I doubt whether I’ll succeed. Just understand - you’re marrying a golf addict.”

“I can live with that,” said Bette, “now I’ll tell you my secret  - I’m a hooker.”

“A hooker?” Alf repeated. “I can live with that. Next time, keep your head down and your left arm straight, then swing through the ball....”

### #451 The Rabbi and the Parrots

One day, Hette approaches her Rabbi after the service and says to him, "Rabbi, I have a problem.  I have two female talking parrots, but they only know how to say one thing."

"What do they say?" the Rabbi asks.

"They only know how to say, 'Hello, we're prostitutes, want to have some fun?'"

"Why, that's terrible!" the Rabbi says, "but I have a solution to your problem.  Bring your two female parrots over to my house tomorrow and I will put them with my two male talking parrots whom I taught to pray and read Hebrew. My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase and your female parrots will learn to praise and worship."

"Oh thank you, Rabbi," Hette replies.

The next day Hette brings her female parrots to the Rabbi's house. His two male parrots are wearing tiny yamulkes and praying in their cage.  Hette puts her two female parrots in with the male parrots and the female parrots say, "Hello, we're prostitutes, want to have some fun?"

One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims, "Put away the siddurs!  Our prayers have been answered!"

### #452 The two sons

Bette and Freda were talking about their sons, both of whom were serving prison sentences.

Bette says: "Oy, my son Michael has it so hard. He is locked away in maximum security, he never even speaks to anyone or sees the light of day. He has no exercise and he lives a horrible life."

Freda says: "Well, my son David is in minimum security. He exercises every day, he spends time in the prison library, takes some classes, and writes home each week.

"Oy," says Bette, "You must get such naches from David."

### #453 The boat trip

Paul and Bernard are out enjoying themselves one afternoon on a lake when their boat starts sinking.

Bernard says to Paul, "So listen, Paul, I have a problem, you know I don't swim at all well."

But luckily, Paul remembered how to carry another swimmer from his lifeguard class years ago when he was just a youngster and so he begins pulling Bernard towards safety. After fifteen minutes of this, however, Paul begins to grow quite tired – all his energy had left him. And finally, just 100 feet from land, Paul asks Bernard, "So Bernard, do you suppose you could float alone?"

Bernard replies, " Paul, this is a hell of a time to be asking about money!"

### #454 The janitor

Bernard is not the brightest of men and is finding it very difficult to find a job. But one day, he applies for and gets a job as a janitor at the local Catholic Church. They decide to give Bernard a trial run and see what it is like for a Jewish man to work in a church. Bernard works very hard indeed.

After a week, he is called into the office. "Bernard, things are working out fine. I just have a few corrections. First, when you wash your hands, use the bathroom, don't use the holy water. Second, when you hang your coat up, use the cloakroom, do not hang it on the cross. Third, my name is Mother Superior, not Mother Shapiro!"

---

### #455 The marriage ceremony

Four young novice nuns were about to take their vows. Dressed in their white gowns, they came into the chapel where the Mother Superior was waiting to perform the ceremony to marry them to Jesus. Just as the ceremony was about to begin, four Chassidic Jews with yarmulkes, long sideburns and long beards, carrying siddurs, came in and sat in the front row.

The Mother Superior said to them, "I am honoured that you would want to share this experience with us, but do you mind if I ask you why you came?"

One of the four Jews replied, "We're from the groom's side."

### #456 The wise man

One day, Bernie was trying to pull out of a parking place but to his horror, he hit the bumper of the car parked in front of him. To make matters worse, the incident was witnessed by a handful of people waiting for a bus.

So Bernie got out of his car, inspected the damage carefully, took out a pen and a piece of paper and wrote a note, which he then left under the wiper blade of the other car.

This is what the note said. “Hello, I have just hit your car and there are some people here watching me. They think I am writing this note to leave you my name, phone number and car registration number. But I am not.”

### #457 The visitor

David is visiting his parents for dinner one Friday night. Whilst she is getting the table ready, his mother asks him to get the olives from the fridge. He opens the fridge to look for the olives and notices that taped to the inside of the door is a risqué photo of a lovely, slender, perfectly built, but naked young woman.

David asks, “Mum, what’s the photo for?

She replies, “Oh, I put that there to remind me not to eat too much.”

David then asks, “So, is it working?”

“Yes and no.” she replies. “I’ve lost 15 pounds but your father has gained 20 pounds!”

### #460 Dead What?"

Moishe was an elderly man and resided in a nursing home in Hendon. One day he went into the office and informed his nurse that his penis had died. Realizing that Moishe was old and forgetful, she decided to play along with him.

"It did? I'm sorry to hear that, Moishe," she replied.

Two days later, Moishe was walking down the hall at the nursing home with his penis hanging outside his pants. His nurse saw him and said, "Moishe, I thought you told me your penis had died."

"It has," Moishe replied, "today is the viewing."

### #461 Relationships

Moishe and his wife Sadie are having dinner at an upmarket restaurant in Golders Green when an attractive young redhead walks by, smiles at Moishe and says, "Hello Moishe."

Sadie immediately asks, "And who was that girl who just spoke to you?"

Moishe replies, "Oh her, that's my mistress."

"You have a mistress? I don’t believe you. How long has this been going on?" says Sadie.

"About ten years, on and off." answers Moishe.

"Ten years?", says Sadie. "You bastard! I'll see a solicitor tomorrow and start divorce proceedings. I’ll ruin you, you wait and see."

"Now hold on Sadie," responds Moishe, "just think about it for a minute. If we get a divorce, you will only get only half of what we have together now. You won't have our big house in Hampstead, you’ll no longer get a new Lexus as your birthday present from me each year, you won't be able to play golf all day with your friends, you won’t …."

But before Moishe can continue, a blonde walks past and says to him, "Hello, nice to see you again."

Sadie asks, "And who was that, another of your ‘girls’?"

Moishe replies, "No, that's Hyme’s mistress."

"You mean that Hyme also has a mistress?" says Sadie, surprised.

Moishe answers, "Of course, she’s been with him for nearly twelve years."

Sadie then says, proudly, "I like ours a lot better."

"Absolutely, darling. Isn't is wonderful what one can do with money these days?"

### #463 The prayers

Sadie was a Reuters journalist. One year, she was assigned to their Jerusalem office and her apartment overlooked the Wailing Wall. On her first morning, as she was getting ready to go to the office, she looked out her window and saw an old man praying vigorously, his head bobbing up and down rapidly. So Sadie, seeing an interesting story in the making, went down to talk to him.

Sadie asked him, "How often do you come here to pray?"

"Every day," he replied. "I have come here to pray on this spot every day for the last 20 years."

"You come every day to the wall? What are you praying for?" Sadie asked.

The old man replies," I pray for peace in this angry world in the morning. Then I go home, have my lunch, and come back in the afternoon. Then I pray for a world free of illness and disease."

Sadie is amazed. "How do you feel coming here every day for 20 years and praying for these things?" she asks.

The old man looks at her sadly. "Like I'm talking to a wall."

Moishe was 80 years old and his family decided he needed a full medical check-up. The doctor listened to his heart and then said, "Uh uh!"

Moishe did not like what he had heard and asked the doctor what the problem was.

"Well," said the doctor, "I can quite clearly hear a serious heart murmur. Do you drink?"

"No," replied Moishe.

"Do you smoke?

"No." replied Moishe.

"Well then, do you have a sex life?"

"Well, now that you ask me, yes." said Moishe.

"Well then, Moishe, that’s the problem," said the doctor, "I'm afraid you'll have to give up half your sex life if you want your heart to last."

Moishe asked, "Which half should I give up, the looking or the thinking?"

### #467 The slip

One day, Jacob, a Russian Jew slipped on the wet riverbank and fell into the water. Unfortunately, Jacob could not swim and was in serious danger of drowning. Two Tsarist policemen heard cries for help and rushed over. But when they saw that it was a Jew, they laughed and just stood their watching him drown.

"Help, I can't swim," shouted Jacob.

"Then you will just have to drown," they replied.

Suddenly Jacob shouts with his last breath: "Down with the Tsar!"

The policemen immediately rushed into the river, pulled Jacob out, and arrested him for trouble making.

### #469 How embarrassing!

Sadie was taking her seven year old daughter Sarah and her friend Rifka to Hebrew classes one Sunday morning and was embarrassed to hear this conversation between them.

### #470 The early morning call

It's nearly four o’clock in the morning and Sadie wakes up to see her husband pacing up and down the bedroom floor.

"Moishe, come back to bed, it’s not yet morning" she tells him.

Moishe replies, "I can’t go to sleep. You know the £10,000 I borrowed from our next door neighbour, Bernie. Well, it’s due to be repaid tomorrow and I don't have the money. I just don't know what I'm going to do."

So Sadie gets out of bed and opens the bedroom window. "Bernie," she shouts on top of her voice, "Bernie, Bernie."

Finally a very tired looking Bernie opens his window and shouts, "You’re crazy, Sadie. Don’t you know it’s nearly 4 o’clock in the morning? What the hell do you want?"

Sadie shouts back, "Bernie, you know the £10,000 my husband owes you? Well, he doesn't have it."

Then she slams the window shut, turns to Moishe and says, now you can go to sleep and let Bernie pace the floor."

### #471 Grandpa & Grandma

Grandpa David & Grandma Andrea were staying overnight at their grandson Paul’s house when Grandpa David saw a bottle of Viagra pills in the bathroom cabinet. He asked Paul whether he could use one of the pills.

Paul said, "I don't think you should take one, Zeida, they're very potent and expensive."

"How much?" asked Grandpa David.

"£10 for each pill," Paul replied.

"I don't care," said Grandpa David, "I'd like to try Viagra at least once before I die. But don’t worry, if I do take one, I'll pay you for it."

The next morning Paul found a cheque for £110 on the kitchen table. He said to Grandpa David, "Zeida, I told you each pill was £10, not £110."

"I know," said Grandpa David, "The extra hundred is from your Bubba."

### #472 Jewish Marriage?

Moishe was sitting at the breakfast table one Sunday morning reading the News of the World. He had just read an article about a beautiful film star who had announced that she was going to marry a football player who was famous not only for his aggression on and off the field, but also for his lack of IQ and common sense. In fact he was ‘thick as two planks’.

Like many men, Moishe loved hearing his own voice and liked to report aloud stories he read from the paper. So he turned to his wife Sadie and said, "I’ll never understand why the biggest schmucks get the most attractive wives."

Sadie replied, "Why thank you, darling!"

### #473 The shopping trip

It was a terrible evening in Golders Green. The wind was blowing hard, it was snowing and it was very, very cold. The streets were almost deserted and ‘Bagels Bakery’ was just about to shut when Sidney entered. He looked absolutely frozen. He was wearing two jumpers, a thick scarf and an even thicker coat. His umbrella had blown inside out and he looked thoroughly miserable.

As he unbuttoned his coat, he said to the baker, "Two bagels, please."

The baker looked surprised. "Only two? Don’t you want anything else?"

"No. I only want two," Sidney replied. "One for Esther and one for me."

"Is Esther your wife?" asked the baker.

"Don’t ask silly questions," replied Sidney, "Of course she is. Do you think my mother would send me out on a night like this?"

### #474 The drinker

It is Saturday night and Sean is in an Irish pub in Cricklewood. He soon strikes up a conversation with the fellow next to him at the bar. Sean says, "I must stop drinking all this Irish whiskey."

"Why do you want to do that?" asked his companion.

"Because every Saturday night I go out and drink a half a bottle of the stuff, come home drunk, make mad passionate love to my wife, wake up Sunday morning, and go to church."

"What's wrong with that?" the friend asks. "A lot of good Irishmen go out on Saturday night, drink a half bottle of good Irish whiskey, come home drunk, make love to the wife, and go to mass on Sunday."

"I know," said Sean, "but I'm Jewish."

### #477 The date

Becky and Sadie had both lost their husbands and were hoping to find new partners. One day, Sadie says to Beckie, "That nice Bernie Schwartz asked me out for a date the other day. I know you went out with him recently so tell me about him before we meet.

Becky replies, "Well OK, I'll tell you. He shows up at my apartment exactly on time, just like a quartz clock. And like a mench he is dressed - fine jacket, beautiful shirt and a smart tie. He brings me my favourite chocolates, you know, the ones I would die for. And he comes in an expensive Lexus car, no less, with a uniformed chauffeur wearing a peaked cap. So then he takes me out to dinner in Baker Street, a kosher restaurant even, just as I would have wanted. Then we go see a West End show. Oh Sadie, I enjoyed that evening so much. But when we come back to my apartment for a coffee, everything changes. He suddenly goes completely crazy. He grabs hold of me, tears off my expensive Cerruti dress like it was made of paper and, and ….he had his way with me!"

Sadie says, "Oy vey!...So are you are telling me I shouldn't go out with him?"

Becky replies, "No. All I’m saying is if you do go out with him, wear shmutters."

### #478 The accident

Moishe was in a terrible car accident, which mangled his "manhood" and tore it from his body. His doctor assured him that modern medicine could give him back his manhood, but that he would have to go privately to have this done - such an operation was not available under the National Health. Although Moishe did not have any private medical cover, he told the doctor that it was not going to be a problem – it was so important, he would pay for it out of his savings.

"So how much will it cost?" asked Moishe.

"£4,500 for a small one, £7,500 for medium and £12,000 for large."

Moishe said, "Then I’ll have the large one, please."

But the doctor urged him to talk it over with his wife before making such an important decision and left the room to allow Moishe to call his wife on his mobile.

Moishe spent 10 minutes discussing his options with Sadie and when the doctor came back into the room, he found Moishe looking utterly dejected.

"Well, what have the two of you decided?" asked the doctor.

Moishe answered, "Sadie said she'd rather have a new kitchen."

### #480 Confessions

Morris and Becky were chatting one evening. Morris says, "Becky, it’s our 50th wedding anniversary soon, so tell me, have you ever been unfaithful to me?"

Becky hesitated for a moment, then said, "Yes, darling, 3 times."

"3 times? How did this happen?" Morris asks her.

"Well, Morris, You remember you lost your job a year after we got married and we had no money and we thought we might have to sell our house? Do you also remember that I went to see the bank manager to ask for an overdraft? Well, we got our overdraft and that’s when it happened."

"It’s hard to accept," Morris said, "but as you did this for us, I can forgive you."

Becky continued, "And you remember years later when you almost died from your heart problem because we couldn't afford the operation? Remember that immediately after I went to see the surgeon at his house, he did your operation for nothing? Well, that’s when it happened."

"Yes," Morris said, "that shocks me too, but as you did it because you loved me, I forgive you. But tell me, Becky, what was the third time?"

Becky responded, "Do you remember, Morris, when you were trying to get elected as the synagogue Chairman... and you needed just 12 more votes?"

Little Moishe asks his father, “Dad, where do clouds come from?”

His father replies, “Good question, son. I wish I knew that myself.”

Moishe then asks, “Dad, how does rain come out of the clouds?”

His father replies, “Interesting question, son. I must look that up later on.”

Moishe then asks, “When lightening happens, Dad, why does it always come before the thunder?”

His father replies, “I used to know that, son, but I’ve forgotten the answer.”

Then little Moishe asks, “Do you mind me asking you all these questions, Dad?”

His father replies, “No, of course not son. If you don’t ask, you don’t learn!”

### #485 Bright spark

When Albert Einstein was young, he was regularly invited to speak at various conferences. But he nearly always found himself wishing that he was back in his laboratory carrying out further pioneering work.

One day, Einstein said to his chauffeur, "Issy, I am getting so very tired of making these speeches, but what on earth can I do? ".

Issy replied, "I have an idea, sir. I've heard you give your presentation many times before and I'll bet I could quite easily give your talk for you. Why, I even look and speak like you." Einstein thought for a while, then laughed and replied, "What a good idea Issy, why not?

So for the next conference, they exchanged clothes. Einstein put on Issy’s uniform and peaked cap and then got behind the wheel of the car. When they arrived at the conference centre, Einstein went and sat at the back of the theatre and wondered how Issy would cope. He needn’t have worried. Issy gave an excellent speech and even answered the first few of the questions that followed. But then one of the other professors asked Issy an extremely awkward question about the speed of light in relation to the formation of anti-matter. Quick as a flash, Issy replied, "The answer to your question is easy. In fact it is so basic that I will ask my chauffeur, who is sitting at the back of the hall, to answer it for me."

### #486 The nurse

Bernie was almost 90 years old and found it difficult to keep his balance. After his latest fall, his daughter thought it was now time for her dad to have a full time nurse looking after him.

Freda duly arrived and on her first night, Bernie was as usual sitting on his plastic-covered couch watching TV. All of a sudden, he started to lean over to the right. Freda quickly pulled him upright. Then Bernie started slowly to lean over to the left and Freda once again rushed over and straightened him up. This rigmarole went on for some time.

Later that evening, the telephone rang. Bernie picked it up.

"Hello Dad, it's me, Hette," said his daughter. "Is the new nurse doing her job properly?"

"Oh Hette, I’m so glad you rang. You must get over here as soon as you can," Bernie answered.

Hette replied, "Why, Dad, whatever’s wrong?"

Bernie then whispered into the phone, "The tyrant won't let me fart."

### #487 A visit to a solicitor

Even though Morris and Sadie had been married for a very, very long time, they still decided to visit a divorce lawyer in Camden Town. At the first meeting, the solicitor asks them, "Why in the world do you want to get divorced? You each look well into your nineties. Why now of all times?"

Morris replies, "Actually, I'm 102 and my wife Sadie is 101."

The solicitor is totally bemused and asks them again "So why do you want a divorce now?"

Sadie replies this time, "Well, we wanted to wait until all of the children were dead."

### #488 A visit home

Deborah had left home to go to London to work as a secretary. Soon after, she began regularly sending money to her parents, Moishe and Sadie.

Some years later, Sadie asked Deborah to come home for a visit, as her father was getting frail. Deborah said she would come to see them that weekend.

You can imagine Moishe and Sadie’s surprise when Deborah pulled up outside their house in a Rolls Royce and stepped out wearing fur and diamonds.

As she walked into the house, Moishe muttered aloud, "It seems that London secretaries get well paid." Deborah walked over to him, took his hands and said, "Daddy - I've been meaning to tell you something for years but I just didn't want to put it in a letter. I can't hide it from you any longer. I've become a prostitute."

Moishe gasped, put his hand over his heart and fell to the floor. The doctor was immediately called, but could not help - Moishe had clearly lost the will to live. He was put to bed and the Rabbi was called. As the Rabbi was comforting Sadie and Deborah, Moishe muttered weakly, "What a way to go – murdered by my own daughter, killed by the shame of what you've become!"

"Daddy, please, please forgive me," Deborah sobbed. "I wanted to have nice things to wear and to have enough money to be able to send you some. The only way I could think of doing that was to become a prostitute."

On hearing this, Moishe sat bolt upright in bed, looking already so much better. Smiling he said, "Deborah, did you say prostitute? I thought you said Protestant"

### #489 The lover

Shlomo, 80, marries Becky, a lovely 25-year-old. Because of the great difference in their ages, Becky thought it sensible to book separate hotel rooms on their honeymoon - she was worried that he might overexert himself.

On the first night, Becky is preparing herself for bed when there is a knock on her door. When she opens it, there is Shlomo ready for action. They unite in conjugal union and it was good. Shlomo says goodnight and leaves. Becky once again prepares to go to bed.

But five minutes later, there's a knock on her door. It’s Shlomo again, once more ready for action. Pleasantly surprised, Becky again invites him into her bed and again they make passionate love. Shlomo kisses her goodnight and leaves.

Becky is now quite tired but as soon as she puts her head on the pillow, there is a knock at the door and there, yet again, is Shlomo, looking very sprightly and once more ready for l-o-v-e. Again they make it.

This time, before Shlomo leaves, Becky says, "I am really very impressed with you, Shlomo. I thought you were past making love, but you’ve proved me wrong. I’ve made a good choice in you - you're a special lover. Most of my other lovers could only manage it once, yet you were able to do it three times."

On hearing this, Shlomo was very confused. He then looks her in the eyes and asks, "Do you mean I’ve been here already?"

### #490 The Catman

It was midnight and it was a cold night in Golders Green when all of a sudden a burglar alarm goes off. The police are immediately called and surprisingly arrive just in time to catch the thief as he is leaving the jewellers with a bag full of Rolex watches and other valuable items. When he is brought to the police station, the officer on duty immediately recognises him. He is known as Morris the Catman. One week later, Morris appears in Court.

"Did you have an accomplice?" the judge asks him.

"What's an accomplice?" asks Morris.

"A partner," replies the judge. "In other words, did you commit this crime by yourself?"

"Of course, what else?" says Morris, "Who can get reliable help these days?"

### #491 The Rabbi’s visit

One Sunday morning, Rabbi Rabbinovitz goes to visit Samuel Lyons.

"Shalom, Sam. I’ll come straight to the point. I’ve come here because our synagogue needs your help. You’ve been a member for over 20 years and I realise that you’re always quick to pay your membership fees in full. But as you are aware, we are in a financial crisis. I've come here to ask you for a little extra for the new school building fund."

"How much are you looking to get from me - how big is little?" asks Sam.

"I’ll be honest. £10,000 would be a tremendous help to us," replies the Rabbi."

Sam responds, "Rabbi, my daughter Rebecca is soon getting married and she has asked me for £25,000 to help her buy that house she saw in Hampstead. And my son David is just starting at Manchester University and he wants £25,000 to see him through the difficult first year there. My wife Sadie wants a hysterectomy and she has asked for £30,000 for the doctors’ fees and in-patient facilities. And that’s not all. You know from your own experience that to keep my mother in a nursing home, they are asking £35,000. So Rabbi, if I can say 'no' to them, I can say 'no' to you."

### #492 Fish bait

Moishe went out fishing. He had driven by the lake many times before and had seen some other anglers about, so he decided to give his luck a try. On his first day of fishing he had no luck at all but noticed that another fisherman near him was scooping in one fish after another. Moishe had to know the secret.

"Excuse me, would you mind telling me what sort of bait you’re using?" he asked.

The other man looked around a bit embarrassed. "Well, I am a surgeon, and quite by accident I found that human tonsil works very well."

Moishe couldn’t match that. He thanked the man and left.

Next day, Moishe returned to the lake, tried a different bait but still had no luck. Just as before, there ahead was another man reeling in fish after fish.

"Excuse me," asked Moishe, "but could you suggest a bait that I could try?"

"Well, I can but I am not sure it will do you any good. I am a doctor and I’m using a bit of human appendix."

"Hmm," thought Moishe. “I can’t match that. It seems that the fish in this lake will require a little more effort than normal.”

He left, willing to give the lake one more try.

On the third day, Moishe still had no luck. As usual, there was another man near him bringing in lots of fish. Moishe had to confirm what he already knew.

"Excuse me sir, but are you a doctor?"

"No, I am a mohel."

### #494  Pesach problem

It is not generally known that a few years ago the Jewish community in Madrid discovered at the last moment that they had no horseradish for making chrain for Pesach. All the countries they asked replied in the same way, "Sorry, we have none left to send you."

So, in desperation, the Spanish Chief Rabbi called his friend in Israel and begged him to immediately send him some horseradish by air freight. He agreed and three days before Pesach, a crate of the best grade of tear-jerking Israeli horseradish was loaded onto an El Al Flight to Madrid. All seemed to be going OK but when the Chief Rabbi went to the airport to pick up his desperately needed horseradish, he was shocked to learn that there was a strike and that no crates of any kind would be unloaded at the airport for at least four days.

So, as it is said, “The chrain in Spain stayed mainly on the plane.”

### #495 The haircuts

A priest goes to a hairdressing salon, has a haircut, thanks the hairdresser and asks him how much he owes. The hairdresser replies, "Father, you're a holy man, a man of the cloth, I just couldn't charge you anything, it's on the house." The priest is most grateful and says, "Thank you, my son" and leaves. When the hairdresser goes to open his shop next morning, almost by magic, he finds 12 gold coins on his doorstep.

Some days later, a Buddhist monk goes to the same hairdressing salon for a shave and a wax. When he goes to pay, the hairdresser says, "You don’t have to give me any money, you're a spiritual leader, a man of the people, I just couldn't charge you anything, it's on the house." The monk bows, shakes his hand and thanks him. When the hairdresser goes to open his shop next morning, almost by magic, he finds 12 rubies on his doorstep.

The following week a Rabbi goes into the hairdressing salon to have a haircut and a beard trim. When he goes to pay, the hairdresser says, "No, Rabbi, I couldn’t ask you to pay anything, it’s on the house, you are a learned and wise man, go in peace." The Rabbi blesses him and leaves. When the hairdresser goes to open his shop next morning, almost by magic, he finds 12 Rabbis on his doorstep.

There are now many kinds of scientist around with much more prestige than doctors. It therefore follows that in future, many Jewish boys are going to become scientists instead of doctors."

"I can’t agree with you at all on this one," replied Freda.

"Why on earth not?" said Hette.

"Because, my dear Hette," replied Freda, "it's much more difficult to say, 'My son, the nuclear physicist.'"

### #499 Moses, I supposes

One day, George W. Bush was in an airport lobby when he couldn’t help but notice a very tall striking man standing on his own in the departure lounge. The man was wearing a long flowing white robe, and had a long flowing white beard, flowing white hair, a staff in one hand and some stone tablets in the other.

GWB was so sure he knew who he was that he felt he had to say something to him. So GWB approached him and asked, "You’re Moses, aren’t you."

The man just stared at the ground and totally ignored GWB.

GWB wasn’t going to give up on this, so he stood right in front of the man and again asked, this time more loudly, " You’re Moses, aren’t you."

The man continued to stare at the floor.

GWB was having none of this. He grabbed hold of the man's arm and asked once again, " You’re Moses, aren’t you."

At last the man looked up and answered, "Yes, I am Moses".

GWB then asked, "Do you know who I am?"

The man replied, "Yes, I know who you are. That’s why I tried to ignore you. The last time I spoke to a Bush, I had to spend forty years in the desert".

### #501 Religious instruction?

A young, popular, but controversial teacher tells her 3rd year class that she is an atheist and asks if there are any other atheists in the class, they must put up their hands.

Not really knowing what an atheist was, but wanting to follow their teacher, all but one of them immediately put up their hands. The exception was Natalie.

The teacher asks Natalie why she wants to be different to all the others.

"Because I'm not an atheist," she replies.

"So what are you then?" asks the teacher.

"I'm Jewish."

The teacher asks Natalie why she is Jewish.

"I was brought up knowing and loving God. My Mother is Jewish and my father is Jewish, so I am Jewish."

"That's not a good enough reason," the teacher says loudly. "What if your mum was a moron, and your dad was a moron. What would you be then?"

"Then I'd be an atheist," says Natalie, smiling.

### #502 "Who Needs Food?"

It’s breakfast time. Sadie asks her husband Moishe, "Would you like some scrambled eggs, perhaps a piece of toast and grapefruit and coffee to follow?"

Moishe replies, "No thanks, it's this Viagra, it's really taken the edge off my appetite."

At lunchtime, Sadie asks Moishe if he would like something to eat. "How about a bowl of your favourite home made vegetable soup, followed by a cheese and tomato sandwich on rye?" she inquires.

Moishe again declines. "It's this Viagra, it's really taken the edge off my appetite."

Come dinnertime, Sadie asks Moishe if he wants anything to eat. She'll go to the delicatessen and buy him some food. Would he like a nice juicy lamb chop with a tasty stir-fry followed by apple pie and cream?

Again, Moishe says, "No thanks, it's this Viagra, it's really taken the edge off my appetite."

"Well," Sadie says, "Would you mind getting off me and letting me up? I'm starving."

### #503 Jewish Santa

Father Christmas was on duty, working in the Brent Cross Shopping Centre. When a little girl comes up to his table, Santa asks her, "What’s your name, dear, and what do you want for Christmas?"

The girl replies, "My name is Mary and I would like a new Barbie doll for Christmas, please."

Santa tells her, "I will add your Barbie doll to my list, but for now, please take a present from my toy sack."

Then a little boy comes up to his table. Santa asks him, "What’s your name, boy, and what do you want for Christmas?"

The boy replies, "My name is Peter and I want a Harry Potter remote control car for Christmas."

Santa tells him, "I will add your Harry Potter car to my list, but for now, please take a present from my toy sack."

Then another little boy comes up to his table. Santa asks him, "What’s your name, handsome, and what do you want for Christmas?"

The boy replies, "My name is Moishe and I'm Jewish. I’m not allowed to ask for anything from Santa."

Santa points to his toy sack and whispers in the boy's ear, "Nem tzvay." (take two)

### #504 Tailor, Tailor and Tailor

In the middle of Whitechapel, London, there was a little street with just five shops in it. Every shop was a tailor's shop, except for one, which was empty.

The first was called George’s Tailor Shop. On its sign was, "Best tailors in the area."

The second was called Mick’s Tailor Shop. Its sign read, "Best tailors in London."

Then came "The Tailor Shop". Its sign read, "Best tailors in the UK."

The fourth was "Baring & Gilow’s Tailors". On its big sign were the words, "Best tailors in the world."

So Moishe Cohen took a lease on the fifth shop, the empty one, and Moishe decided to call it "Cohen’s – Best tailors in the street!"

### #505 The cure

Moishe and Sadie were touring the Middle East. As part of the day's itinerary, they took a trip to the local bazaar. The couple visited many of the shops there and spoke to numerous vendors who were dotted around the square. One of the stalls was selling sandals. But not any old sandals, said the owner. "My sandals will increase the sexual prowess of whoever wears them. I guarantee this."

Moishe told the owner that he wasn't interested, but Sadie looked at Moishe and insisted that he buy a pair. She said it might help him. Seeing that look in her eyes, he decided it was futile to argue.

Before paying for them, Moishe wanted to make sure that they fitted him, so he tried them on. Immediately, Moishe grabbed hold of the owner, threw him on the table, and started to rip his clothes off.

"Stop, stop", yelled the owner. "You’ve put them on the wrong feet!"

### #506 The negotiation

Moishe the tailor felt it was time to get a wife so one day plucked up courage to visit a marriage broker. The broker immediately offered him a beautiful young lady.

"This girl is quite gorgeous. She’s a real prize, especially as she wants to settle down with a husband right away. Yours would be a wedding made in heaven," said the broker.

But Moishe was a businessman and he never made decisions quickly.

"Look, I need more information," Moishe told her. "Whenever I buy any cloth, I always ask to see some swatches first. So before I decide on a wife, I want to see a sample also."

The broker said she would pass on Moishe’s request directly to the lady in question. She then went to visit the intended bride.

"My client says he is a good businessman and needs to find out exactly what he's buying. He insists on a sample."

"OK," replied the girl, "I understand – I am also good at business. Tell him that I don’t give samples but I am prepared to give him references."

### #507 The pick up

Sadie and Bernie were well into their 80s and were still able to look after themselves. Until, that is, the day a police car pulled up outside their house and out stepped Bernie. The policeman who escorted Bernie to the door was kind and understanding. He explained to Sadie that Bernie told him he was lost in the park and couldn't find his way home.

"Oh Bernie," said Sadie, "How on earth could you get yourself lost? You've been going to that park for over 25 years."

Bernie went up to Sadie and whispered softly in her ear, "Please don’t tell him but I wasn't lost, I was just too tired to walk home."

### #508 The slow learner

Young Bernie Gold was nearly 12 years old and although he had a lower than average IQ, he was a dutiful and caring son. One day, he was having a chat with his father.

"Dad, it’s Father's Day on Sunday and I want to buy you something. Mum said I should ask you what you wanted."

Mr Gold only needed to think for a moment. "What do I want? I only want one thing - you are 12 months away from your Barmitzvah and I would be so very happy if you could learn at last to speak Hebrew."

Bernie groaned aloud, "You know how hard I’m finding it at school to learn new subjects, Dad. I’m such a slow learner. I just don’t think I would be able to learn Hebrew."

Mr Gold looked squarely at his son and said, "Bernie, you’re better than you think you are. I’ll even help you, just as my father helped me. If you could do this for me, it would please me so very much!"

"OK, I'll try Dad, just for you, but please don’t be angry with me if I fail."

So next Sunday, they went to see the Rabbi and soon after that, Bernie was enrolled in the synagogue’s Hebrew classes. Over the months that followed, Bernie kept his promise by attending regularly and trying as hard as he could.

One day, Mr Gold decided to visit the synagogue and check on Bernie’s progress. He entered the class in the middle of a lesson and when it came to Bernie’s turn to read, Mr Gold was soon dismayed to discover how little Hebrew Bernie could manage after all the months that had gone by. Bernie was very slow and made many mistakes in his reading.

But even worse, Mr Gold realized that what he was hearing from Bernie was the beginning of the Kaddish. He was shocked – the Kaddish is the prayer for the dead, the words that every son is expected to say after the father's death.

"Rabbi, what on earth are you teaching my son?" argued Mr Gold after the lesson was over. "I'm only in my 40s - I’m a young man still in good health. I go jogging and Israeli dancing every week. Do I really look so ill that you are teaching Bernie to say the Kaddish now?"

The Rabbi replied, "Mr Gold, please God you should live so long that Bernie is able to say the whole of the Kaddish over you!"

### #509 23rd Psalm for Jewish Princesses

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

He leadeth me to Brent Cross

He giveth me energy for shopping

He restoreth my credit card

He teacheth me to make restaurant reservations

He leadeth me past Woolworths for mine own sake

Yea, though I walk by Next, I shall not go in, for thou art with me.

Thy fashionable clothes they comfort me

Thou preparest diamond jewellery for me in the presence of mine enemies

Thou anointest my face with Chanel cosmetics

My cup overflows

Surely designer clothes shall follow me to the end of my days

And I will walk on Golders Green Road forever.

### #510 Match that

Moishe Cohen was 82 years old and had made an appointment with Doctor Michaels who was very well known for his work in curing impotence. Doctor Michaels examined Moishe carefully and then said to him, "Mr Cohen, I’ve examined every part of you and I can honestly say that you're in excellent condition for a man of your age. So tell me, why are you really here?"

Moishe replied, "My friend Bernie has told me he makes love to his wife 5 times a week, and I can’t do that, Doctor."

Doctor Michaels smiled and said, "Yes you can. You can also say you make love as many times a week as you like."

### #511 First job

Rabbi Bloom had just accepted a junior role at a NW London synagogue for his first posting. The senior Rabbi there, Rabbi Gold, was well loved by his congregation and considered to be very wise with a wicked sense of humour.

One day, not long after he joined, Rabbi Bloom said to Rabbi Gold, "You know I told you during my interview that I had won many prizes in the Yeshiva for my sermons? Well, I don’t think there is a subject in the world that I could not instantly find a Biblical text for and then incorporate it into a sermon." Rabbi Gold couldn’t help but decide to put him to the test.

"Rabbi Bloom," he said, "I want you to give my sermon next Shabbos. But there will be no need to prepare it in advance. Instead, when you get into the pulpit, you will find a sealed envelope and inside the envelope will be a single sheet of paper on which I will have written a one-word topic. I challenge you to find any kind of text that will fit." Rabbi Bloom thanked Rabbi Gold for the opportunity and said he looked forward to the challenge with relish.

The day came. Rabbi Bloom walked up the stairs to the pulpit, opened the envelope, looked at the sheet of paper on which was written "constipation", and started his sermon. "And Moses took the two tablets and went off down the mountain....."

### #512 The cure

Moishe went to see his doctor because he was suffering from a miserable cold that wouldn’t clear up. His doctor prescribed him some pills, but they didn't help. On his next visit, the doctor gave Moishe an injection, but that didn't do any good, either.

On his third visit, the doctor told Moishe to go home and take a hot bath. Then, as soon as he got out the bath, he must open all the windows and stands in the draft.

"But doctor," protested Moishe, "I'll get pneumonia."

"I know," said his doctor, "I can cure pneumonia."

### #513 The root of our troubles

Did you know that the horseradish root goes back in time as far as the matzoh does? The horseradish root also crossed the Red Sea with the fleeing Israelites. The Israelites were slaves at the time and only had access to a few vegetables. The hard and woody horseradish was one of them and was a household staple.

Nearly all the fleeing Israelites took horseradish with them. Moishe and Sadie, however, while gathering up their scant belongings, found to their dismay that they had run out of horseradish. Sadie immediately sent Moishe into the field to dig up a large horseradish root to take with them. However, because it was dark and everyone was running around in panic, Moishe dug up a ginger root by mistake.

After forty years in the desert, the Israelites finally entered the Promised Land – all, that is, except Moishe and Sadie. It took them forty-one years to arrive. When asked where they had been, Sadie, now grown old, shrugged her shoulders and replied, "Moishe insisted on taking an alternative root."

### #514 A visit to her husband

It's the yahtzeit of Bernie Gold’s death and Sadie, his widow, goes to the cemetery to clean his grave, read a prayer and then place a small stone on the marble, as is the tradition, to show that the deceased is remembered.

But because she hadn’t visited his grave for some years, Sadie cannot find Bernie’s resting place and has to ask an attendant for help. He escorts her to the cemetery office where all the records are kept.

He made her a cup of coffee and then spent time looking at maps and lists. After 30 minutes, he finally turns to Sadie and says, "I can find no record of a Bernie Gold buried at this cemetery. Are you sure he is here? All I can find is the grave of Sadie Gold"

"That's him!" Sadie shouts out. "Bernie always put everything in my name."

### #515 Pharaoh in need of counselling?

At Passover, we read the story of Moses and how God brought 9 plagues onto the Pharaoh and the Egyptians. And we read that because the Pharaoh was stubborn and still wouldn’t let the Jews leave Egypt, God had to unleash Plague number 10, despite his previous warning. This was the death of the first-born of every Egyptian family. Only then, after this greatest of terrors, did the Pharaoh release the Jews from slavery and let them leave Egypt to journey to the Promised Land.

But in the face of such convincing evidence that something really bad would happen, why didn’t the Pharaoh release the Jews after the first nine plagues? It took years of research by leading Israeli scholars studying the Dead Sea Scrolls to find the answer. “The Pharaoh was still in deNile”.

### #516 The engineer

Hette arrives home quite late one night and says to her worried Moishe, “Sorry I’m late. I had to come home by train, as I couldn’t get my car to start. But I’m sure I know why.”

“So what’s the problem then, my mechanical engineer of a wife?” asks Moishe.

“I think there’s water in the carburettor,” replies Hette.

“How on earth can you know that?“ says Moishe. “You don’t even know how to open the bonnet or to change the time on the car’s clock yet alone know where the carburettor is.”

“Maybe so,“ says Hette, “but I still think there’s water in it.”

Moishe then says, “OK, I’ll go along with you. Let’s check it out right now. Where did you leave the car?”

Hette replies, “In the lake!”

Bernie was talking to his friend Jack about his rebellious son Yossi. "When I was a youngster and did something wrong, my parents punished me by sending me to my bedroom without supper. I hated it. But our Yossi has his own colour TV, phone, computer and DVD player in his bedroom so we can’t do that - it wouldn’t be much of a punishment."

"So what do you do, then?" asked Jack.

### #520 The arrangements

Although Miriam Cohen had a good job designing clothes in a top shop in Golders Green, she wasn’t satisfied with being single. In fact she and her mother, Freda, shared the same wish – Miriam should marry a wealthy man, please God.

One day, Miriam came home from work with eyes red and sore from crying and went straight to Freda. “Mum, I'm pregnant. Please don't get upset - the father is my boss.” Miriam then began to cry again and Freda had to stay with her most of the night. The next morning, an angry Freda went with Miriam to see her boss.

“Nu, she said, so what's going to happen to Miriam now?“

Miriam’s boss was a handsome, single, well dressed man of 32. He replied, “Please take a seat Mrs. Cohen and don’t worry. I'm taking care of all the arrangements. Before the baby is born, Miriam will have the best doctor money can buy. Later on, she'll be booked into the best private clinic in London and after the baby is born, I will set up a trust fund for Miriam. She will receive £1,000 each week until the baby reaches 21. I can’t do better than that.”

Freda was initially taken aback by this news but then responded, “Tell me,” she said, “God forbid Miriam should have a miscarriage, but if she does, will you give her a second chance?”

### #521 It’s magic

Moishe goes to Brent Cross shopping centre with his ten-year-old son, Paul. Paul is flicking a 20p coin up in the air with his thumb and each time catching it between his teeth. But then someone bumps into Paul and the 20p coin goes straight down his throat. Paul starts to choke and soon begins to turn blue. Moishe starts to panic and shouts and screams for someone to help him.

An ordinary looking man in a blue suit is sitting on a bench drinking coffee and reading his newspaper. He puts down his cup and paper, gets up and walks towards Paul, who is now close to collapse. When he gets to him, the man takes hold of Paul’s testicles and squeezes them gently but firmly. Straight away, Paul coughs up the 20p coin into the man’s free hand. The man gives the coin to Moishe and walks back to his bench to finish off his coffee. Not a word was said during this event.

Moishe is overwhelmed with gratitude and quickly goes over to the man to thank him. The man looks embarrassed and tells Moishe he doesn’t have to thank him. But Moishe says, "You’re a hero. I've never heard of anyone doing what you just did - it was pure magic. What are you, a doctor?"

"Oh, no, " the man replies, "I work for the Inland Revenue."

Soon, however, he just can’t help noticing the handsome young man sitting next to him. Hard as he tries, he can’t stop himself – Joseph puts his hand on the young man's knee.

Immediately two large men rush over to Joseph, pick him up, quickly carry him out of the shul and forcibly throw him out into the street.

As he picks himself up, Joseph says, "Why on earth did you have to do that? I thought this was a gay synagogue."

"It is," one of them replied in a deep voice. "But nobody messes with the rebbetzin."

One Sabbath afternoon, Jacob was in the Rabbi’s office and was looking out the window when he said, "Rabbi, if one sees a cow drowning on the Sabbath, is it permitted to save it or should one let it drown?"

The Rabbi looked up and said, "No, my son, it is not permitted to break the Sabbath over a cow."

"That's a shame," says Jacob. "A cow has fallen into the lake and it’s drowning."

The Rabbi replies, "Yes, it's too bad."

Jacob continues, "Its head is now going under and it's certainly going to die. I feel sorry for the animal."

"Yes," said the Rabbi, "it is not a nice thing to happen, but what can one do on the Sabbath?"

"And I feel so sorry for you," Jacob said.

"Why me?" said the Rabbi looking up.

"It is your cow."

Young Morris asked his father, "Dad, was Adam Jewish?"

His father put down his newspaper and thought for a moment. He was an expert at Talmudic reasoning and in the art of making a point by an unanswerable question.

He replied, "If we can determine that Eve was Jewish, my son, we would at once see that Adam was Jewish, for who but a Jew could bring himself to marry a Jewish girl?" (Here he turned his head a bit nervously to make sure his wife wasn't listening.)

"Therefore, we can drop the Adam problem and instead ask ourselves, "Was Eve Jewish?"

"To answer that, we have only to ask the question, "Would anyone but a Jewish girl say, 'Here, have a piece of fruit'?"

### #532 The lesson

Little Sarah was attending her very first sex education class at her school. During the lesson, she asks her teacher, "Miss, do you think my mother could get pregnant?"

The teacher asks, "How old is your mother, Sarah?"

Sarah replies, "She’s thirty eight years old, Miss."

The teacher then says, "Yes, Sarah, your mother could get pregnant."

Sarah then asks, "Miss, can my big sister also get pregnant?"

The teacher asks, "How old is your sister, Sarah?"

Sarah answers, "She’s eighteen, Miss".

The teacher says, "Oh yes, your sister certainly could get pregnant."

So Sarah then asks, "Can I get pregnant, Miss?"

The teacher asks, "How old are you, Sarah?"

Sarah replies, "I'm seven years old, Miss".

The teacher says, "No, Sarah, you can't get pregnant."

Little Maurice, who is sitting behind Sarah, gives her a poke in the back and says, "see, Sarah, I told you we had nothing to worry about."

### #533 What to choose

Becky is out doing her shopping. She goes into a supermarket and gets totally confused by the large selection of toilet paper they have on their shelves. So she goes up to one of the assistants and asks, "Excuse me. Can you explain the differences between all these toilet rolls, please?"

"Of course," he replies. He points out one brand, "This is our best because it’s as soft as a baby's kiss. It's £1.50 per roll." He picks up another roll and says to her, "This one is also good. It’s nice and soft, strong but gentle and it's £1.00 a roll." Then, pointing to the bottom shelf he tells Becky, "We call that roll our No Name brand, and it's 50p per roll."

"Give me the No Name," says Becky.

One week later, Becky goes back to the shop and seeks out the assistant.

"I've got a name for your No Name toilet paper. I call it John Wayne."

"Why?" he asks.

### #534 Vive la difference

Maurice and Hetty were approaching their Golden wedding anniversary. One summer evening, as they were taking a slow walk in their local park, Hetty suddenly takes her walking stick and hits Maurice hard across his back with it.

"What on earth did you do that for? It really hurts." he shouts at her.

Hetty replies, "That's for 50 years of poor sex."

Maurice thinks for a while and then takes his walking stick and hits Hetty hard across her tuchus with it.

"Ouch," she screams. "What was that for?"

Maurice looks at her and replies, "That's for knowing the difference."

### #537 Room 50

Maurice, 53 years old, thought he was quite fit so he decided to join ‘David’s Place’, the up market London health club. It seemed all the Jews in North London went there.

On his first day, Maurice went to Room 50, the exercise room for over 50s, and tried out their stair-step machine. He told the instructor what he wanted to do and the instructor asked, "Shall I set it for five, ten or twenty minutes?"

"Make it ten," Maurice replied conservatively.

But after only a few minutes on the machine, his legs felt like lead and he could hardly breathe. So he got off the machine. As he limped past some of the other men in Room 50 who were resting from their workouts, Maurice said to them, "I could only take three minutes on that thing."

"OK, OK, " replied one of them, "You don’t have to brag about it."

Well, on this third trip, Moses arrived at the burning bush after much climbing, removed his sandals, kneeled and prayed to God.

"What question do they have for me?" roared the voice of God.

"They want to know whether the commandments are listed according to priority."

### #539 Holiday planning

Sadie, an elderly lady, is sitting in a restaurant in Brent Cross Shopping Centre sipping her tea. Next to her, three nuns were discussing where to go on holiday.

The 2nd nun says to Mother Superior "Let's go to Jerusalem."

"No," says Mother Superior, "there are too many Jews there."

The 3rd nun says to Mother Superior "Let's go to Philadelphia."

"No," says Mother Superior again, "also too many Jews there."

The 2nd nun again speaks and says, "Let's go to Paris."

Yet again Mother Superior replies, "No, too many Jews there too."

Sadie had heard enough.

She leans over and says to them, in a thick, loud Yiddish accent, "Vell, vhy don't you go to Hell, dere are no Jews dere!!!!"

### #540 I’ve given it up

Alf arrives home from work and as soon as he sets foot in the house, Sadie is on to him, telling him that their friend Michael Bloom has finally quit smoking.

"Imagine that, Alf," she says, "someone who smoked 3 packs a day for 20 years has stopped smoking all of a sudden. Now that's what I call will power - something that you definitely don’t have."

But Sadie hadn’t finished.

"And that’s not all. I hear that Bernard, that drunken friend of yours, is finally giving up drinking – another example of the kind of will power that you don’t have."

"OK, Sadie," said Alf, "you want to see will power, do you? Well here's will power. I am going to sleep in the spare room from now on. I am going to prove to you that I won’t be affected at all by not sleeping with a woman."

Alf keeps to his word.

One night, when he had been sleeping alone for a week, there is a knock on his bedroom door.

Alf shouts out, "What do you want?"

Sadie replies, "Bloom has started smoking again."

### #541 Honesty

Maurice and Sarah were Londoners and were blessed with seven healthy children. After many months of discussion, they finally decided to move to New York. It should have been a simple enough move, but when they arrived, they had great difficulty finding a suitable apartment to live in. Although many were big enough, the landlords always seemed to object to such a large family living there. If only Maurice wasn’t so honest about the size of his family!

After several days of unsuccessful searching, Maurice had an idea. He told Sarah to take the four younger children to visit the local cemetery while he went with the older three children to find an apartment. After looking for most of the morning, Maurice found a place that was ideal.

The landlord asked him, "How many children do you have?"

Maurice answered with a deep sigh, "Seven...but four are with their dear mother in the cemetery."

He got the apartment!

### #546 Home return

Moshe had been away on a lengthy business trip and on the plane back home, he began thinking of all the romantic things he would do on his return. So when he came home, he quietly suggested to Becky that they go to bed early that night for a bit of l-o-v-e. But Becky said, "Oh Moishe, I'm so tired from looking after the house all the time you were away. Please, another time if you don’t mind."

The next night Moshe asked again. Becky said, "Oy vay, Moishe, such a terrible headache I have got. I won’t be able to do anything and it wouldn't be any good. Please, wait a bit longer."

On the third night, Moshe had gotten just a little impatient. "How about it?" he said, a bit abruptly.

Becky snapped back at him, "Moishe. This is the third night in a row you've asked me. What are you? Some kind of sex maniac?"

### #550 The kitten

One Sunday morning, Rabbi Bloom’s kitten climbed up a tree in his front garden and wouldn’t come down. He tried everything. He pleaded with it - “Here kitty kitty,” he said, many times over. He placed a bowl of milk by the tree and then placed his pet’s basket by the tree, but the kitten would not budge. So the Rabbi thought about the problem for a while and came up with a solution.

He tied one end of a rope to the tree, attached the other end to his car and drove away slowly. The tree began to bend but every time he got out the car to check, he found he still couldn’t reach his kitten. He tried one more time and drove on a little bit farther. But the rope suddenly broke, the tree snapped upright and the kitten sailed through the air out of sight.

Rabbi Bloom immediately went looking for his kitten. He asked everyone he saw if they'd seen a little kitten, but none had. He was very sad it had gone, it had become good company.

Some days later, he met Freda in the Deli and was surprised to see some cat food in her basket - he knew she hated cats.

" Freda, why are you buying cat food when you hate cats?" he asked.

"You won’t believe me, Rabbi," she replied.  "My daughter Sarah had been begging me for weeks to buy her a cat, but I kept on refusing. A few days ago, Sarah nagged me yet again, and I told her that if God gives her a cat, she could keep it. I watched Sarah go out into the garden, look up to the sky, and ask God for a cat. Really, Rabbi, I know you won't believe this, but I saw it with my own eyes. A cat suddenly came flying out of the empty sky, with its paws spread out, and landed right in front of Sarah. And that’s why I’m buying cat food!"

### #555 The bacon tree

Back in the cowboy days, the westbound wagon train was lost and low on food. No other humans had been seen for days. And then they saw an old Jew sitting beneath a tree.

The leader rushed to him and said, "We're lost and running out of food. Is there someplace ahead where we can get food?"

"Vell," the old Jew said, "I vouldn't go up dat hill und down de other side. Somevun told me you'll run into a big bacon tree."

"A bacon tree?" asked the wagon train leader.

"Yah, ah bacon tree. Trust me. For nuttin vud I lie."

The leader goes back and tells his people that if nothing else, they might be able to find food on the other side of the next ridge.

"So why did he say not to go there?" some pioneers asked.

"Oh, you know those Jews-they don't eat bacon."

So the wagon train goes up the hill and down the other side. Suddenly, Indians attack and massacre everyone except the leader, who manages to escape back to the old Jew, who's enjoying a "glassel tea."

The near-dead man starts shouting. "You old fool!  You sent us to our deaths!

We followed your instructions, but there was no bacon tree. Just hundreds of Indians, who killed everyone."

The old Jew holds up his hand and says "Oy, vait a minute."

He then gets out an English-Yiddish dictionary, and begins thumbing through it. "Gevalt, I made myself ah big mistake."

"It vuz not a bacon tree. It vuz a ham bush!"

### #556 The visitor

Ruth had just stepped out of the shower when she heard her doorbell ring.

“Who is it?” she shouted downstairs.

“It’s the blind man,” came the reply.

Ruth decided it didn’t matter if she opened the door without any clothes on because the man was blind. In fact she thought it would be a rather daring thing to do.

So she opened the door wide and he said, “It’s John Lewis Department Store, Brent Cross. Where do you want me to put these blinds?”

As soon as the waiter came back into the kitchen with the empty plates, Isaac grabbed hold of him and asked, "What did they say, please tell me, what did they say?"

"Nothing at all, Mr Isaac," replied the waiter. "They were all too busy searching for the watermelon seeds and putting them into their pockets."

### #559 Fit for life

Morris had reached 60, so he went to see doctor Myers for a full medical check-up. When he had finished, doctor Myers said, "Relax, Morris, you’re in very good shape. I can’t find anything wrong with you. You’ll probably live till you’re 100. So how old was your father when he died?"

Morris replied, "Did I say he was dead?"

Doctor Myers then asked, "How old is your father, is he still active?"

"He’s 83 and goes jogging and Israeli dancing every week." Morris replied.

Doctor Myers was very surprised. "How old was your grandfather when he died?"

Morris again answered, "Did I say he was dead, doctor?"

Doctor Myers was astonished. "You mean to tell me that you are 60 years old and both your father and grandfather are alive? Is your grandfather active?"

Morris replied, "He goes swimming twice a week, and plays a full round of golf every Sunday, weather permitting. Not only that, he is 107 years old and next month he is getting married again."

Doctor Myers said, "If he’s 107 years old, why on earth would your grandfather want to get married?"

Morris looked Doctor Myers in the eye and said, "Did I say he wanted to?"

### #560 You shouldn’t ask that

When Jacob was finally given an exit visa by the Russians and allowed to emigrate to Israel, he was told he could only take what he could put into one suitcase. At Moscow airport, he was stopped by customs and an official shouted, "Open your case at once."

Jacob did what he was told. The official searched through his case and pulled out something wrapped in newspaper. He unwrapped it and saw it was a bust of Stalin.

"What is that?" he shouted at Jacob.

Jacob replied, "You shouldn't ask 'What is that?' - you should ask 'Who is that?' That is our glorious leader Stalin. I'm taking it to remind me of the wonderful things he did for me and the marvellous life that I am leaving behind."

The official sneered. "I always knew you Jews were mad. Go, and take the bust with you."

When Jacob arrived at Ben Gurion airport, a customs officer said, "Shalom, welcome to Israel, open your case, please!"

Jacob's case was once again searched and not surprisingly the bust was found. "What is that?” asked the officer.

Jacob replied, "You shouldn't ask 'What is that?' - you should ask 'Who is that?' That is Stalin the bastard. I want to spit on it every day to remind me of all the suffering and misery he caused me."

The official laughed, "I always knew you Russian immigrants were mad. Go, and take the bust with you."

When Jacob arrived at his new home, his young nephew watched him as he unpacked. Jacob carefully unwrapped the bust of Stalin and put it on the table. "Who is that?" asked his nephew.

Jacob replied, "You shouldn't ask 'Who is that?' - you should ask 'What is that?' That is five kilos of gold."

### #561 The miracle

Sadie had passed away and her funeral service was being held at Bushey cemetery. Morris, her husband for over 40 years, had tears in his eyes. At the end of the service, as the coffin was being wheeled out, the trolley accidentally bumped into the doorframe and jarred the coffin. To everyone’s total shock, they heard a faint moaning coming from the coffin. They quickly opened it and found that Sadie was alive. Wonder of wonders – a miracle if ever there was one.

Sadie and Morris lived together for 10 more years and then Sadie died. The ceremony was again held at Bushey. At the end of the service, as the coffin was being wheeled out on the trolley, Morris shouted out, "Watch out, don’t hit the doorframe again!"

The operator said, "Please hold while I find someone who can help."

Soon, an authoritative voice said, "I’m the hospital manager. Are you the lady who is asking about one of our patients?"

"Yes," she replied, "I'd like to know exactly how Rifka Levy in Room 23 is doing." He replied, "Levy, now let me see…Lewis, Levine, Levy… yes, I have Mrs Levy’s details here. It says she is doing very well. She's eaten two full meals and her doctor says if she continues improving, he is going to release her on Tuesday. Is that the information you need?"

The woman said, "Yes, it’s wonderful news that she's going home on Tuesday. I'm so happy."

The manager then asked, "From your excitement, you must be one of Mrs Levy’s close family."

She says, "What close family? I am Rifka Levy. My doctor won’t tell me anything.”

### #563 The mezuzah

"Please help me. I'm being held prisoner in a mezuzah factory."

"What's ‘shul’?" they ask.

"Well, come with me and I'll show you." Moishe said.

### #565 False identity

Sadie says to her husband, "Moishe, I'm fed up with frozen chickens. I don’t want any more ‘gershtinkener’ chickens. Please buy me a live chicken for a change. Then, when you bring it home, I'll get the Rabbi to ‘gerharget’ it and kosher it. Then I can make for us a lovely meal."

So Moishe goes to the market and buys the chicken. On his way back, he sees that Funny Girl is showing at the Phoenix cinema, Finchley. So he rings Sadie on his mobile.

"Sadie," he says, "They're showing Funny Girl at the Phoenix. I think I’ll see it before I come home. I missed it first time round and this is a new digitally enhanced release."

"OK," replies Sadie, "but what about the chicken?"

"I'll take it inside with me." Moishe answers. So he stuffs the chicken down his trousers and goes in to see the film.

Unfortunately, during the film, the chicken pokes its head out of Moishe's trousers. Two women are sitting next to Moishe and one turns to the other and whispers, "There’s a man next to me with his shmackel sticking out of his trousers."

Her friend says, "Why be shocked? If you've seen one, you've seen them all."

"But this one's different. It’s eating my Popcorn."

### #566 The three questions

Abe went to see his Rabbi. "Rabbi," he said, "I would be grateful if you could explain the Talmud to me."

"Very well, Abe," said the Rabbi, "First, I need to ask you a simple question."

"If two men climb inside a chimney and one comes out dirty and the other comes out clean, which one washes himself?"

"The dirty one," replied Abe.

"No, Abe. They look at each other. The dirty man thinks he is clean but the clean man thinks he is dirty and washes."

"Now another question," said the Rabbi.

"If two men climb inside a chimney and one comes out dirty and the other comes out clean, which one washes himself?"

Abe smiled, "You just told me that one, Rabbi. The clean man, because he thinks he is dirty."

"No, Abe." said the Rabbi. "They each look at themselves. The clean man knows he doesn't have to wash and the dirty man washes himself."

"Now one final question," said the Rabbi.

"If two men climb inside a chimney and one comes out dirty and the other one comes out clean, which one washes himself?"

This time Abe frowned, "I don't know, Rabbi. It could be either one, depending on your point of view."

"No Abe," said the Rabbi. "If two men climb inside a chimney, how could either of them come out clean? They are obviously both dirty and so they both wash."

Abe was now thoroughly confused, "Rabbi, you asked me exactly the same question three times, yet you gave me three different answers. Are you playing games with me?"

"No, Abe, I would never joke with you. This is Talmud."

### #567 In the lift

As the doors shut and the crowded lift made its way down to the ground floor, Sadie got very angry with her Morris. She noticed that he was wedged up against a nice young girl and had a smile on his face that said he was delighted to be in that position. As the lift reached the ground floor and the doors were about to open, the girl suddenly slapped Morris’s face and said aloud, "I’m not that kind of girl. That will teach you not to pinch my bottom!"

Sadie and Morris didn’t say a word as they made their way to the car park. When they got in the car, Morris turned to Sadie and said, "You know darling, I really didn't pinch that girl."

"Of course you didn't," said Sadie smiling, "I did."

### #568 The present

Harry had some shopping to do at John Lewis department store. He walked into ladies wear, went up to the lingerie counter and quietly said to the women behind the desk, "I'd like to buy a bra as a present for my wife."

"Of course, sir, what type of bra would you like to buy?" she asked.

"What type?" replied Harry, "do you mean to say there is more than one type?"

"Of course. Let me explain," she said and began to show Harry bras in a variety of shapes, sizes, colours and materials. Harry looked bewildered.

"There’s no need to be confused,“ she said, “there are really only four types of bra."

When Harry asked her what the four types were, she replied, "The Catholic type, the Salvation Army type, the Presbyterian type and the Jewish type."

Still confused, Harry asked, "What are the differences between them?"

The saleslady answered, "The Catholic type supports the masses, the Salvation Army type lifts up the fallen, the Presbyterian type keeps them staunch and upright, and the Jewish type makes mountains out of mole hills."

### #569 The chase

Shlomo’s business had done so well that he treated himself to a brand new 5 litre Mercedes convertible. When he picked up the car from the dealers, he decided to take it out on a spin on the Motorway. Soon he was driving at 80 mph with the wind blowing through his hair. "This is brilliant," he said to himself and increased his speed a bit more. But a quick look in his rear-view mirror showed him a police car with flashing lights coming up quickly behind him.

Shlomo thought, "I can easily get away from him," and he started to accelerate away. But then he had another thought, "What the hell am I doing? This is madness," so he quickly pulled over to the side of the road and waited.

The police car pulled up behind him and a policeman got out. He walked up to Shlomo and said, "This just might be your lucky day, sir. Today is Friday the 13th and my shift ends in 3 minutes. If you can give me one good reason why you were speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you off with just a warning."

Shlomo looked at the policeman and said, "Last week, my wife Sadie ran off with a policeman and I thought you were bringing her back. That’s why I was trying to get away from you."

The policeman said, "Enjoy the rest of your day sir."

The Yom Kippur service was coming to an end. In the ladies gallery, Esther, an elderly widow, just couldn’t take her eyes off the young, good looking chazzan who was blowing the shofar to signify the arrival of another new year, She had been obsessed with him for some time and believed she was in love with him.

When the service ended, the chazzan took off his tallit and turned round to talk to one of the congregation. This was her chance. Esther immediately grabbed his tallit and walked away with it – but the Rabbi had seen her. He went over to her and said, “Esther, why don’t you give back the tallit you just took?”

“What tallit?” said Esther.

“The one I just saw you take from our chazzan and hide under your dress, that’s what tallit,” answered the Rabbi.

Esther could deny it no longer. As she raised her dress to remove the tallit, which was tucked into her pantyhose, and because she was so nervous being caught out by the Rabbi, she couldn’t control herself and let out a loud flatulence.

The Rabbi responded, “And when you’ve removed the tallit, could you please also give back the shofar.”

"About 8 years, madam." he replied.

Moishe went to shul regularly but one Sabbath forgot his tallit and had to borrow one from the "visitors’ spares". It was an expensive looking tallit and he was certainly not embarrassed to wear it. At the end of the service, he didn’t really want to hand back this excellent tallit and without thinking, stuffed it down his trousers.

As he was walking past the bimah on his way out, the Rabbi stopped him and whispered, "Moishe, I saw you put the shul tallit down your trousers. I don’t want to know why you did this, but may I suggest you remove it from your trousers now and give it to me."

Moishe was so deeply embarrassed that as he was bending over trying to pull the tallit out of his trouser leg, where it had slipped, he accidentally let out a loud flatulence. The Rabbi, shocked, said, "Moishe, you took the shofar as well?"

### #575 The meeting

Shlomo and Issy had been best friends for a long time, but for one reason or another had not seen each other for years. Then by chance they meet in Brent Cross Shopping Centre. They had so much to talk about that after 30 minutes of chatting, Shlomo invited Issy back to his flat to continue their reminiscences.

"Issy, I’ve a lovely wife and three kids and we would all love to have you come to us tonight for dinner."

Issy replied, "That’s very kind of you, just tell me where you live."

Shlomo wrote it down. "Here's the address, Issy. It’s a block of flats. When you get to the main entrance, kick open the door with your foot, then go into the lobby and call the lift by pressing the button with your elbow. When the lift arrives, get in and press the 6th floor button with your elbow. When you reach the sixth floor, get out and go down the hall on the left until you find room number 607. That’s where we live. Press my bell with your elbow and I'll let you in."

"OK, Shlomo, but tell me... what’s all this kicking open of doors and pressing of buttons with my elbow?"

"Surely, Issy, you're not coming empty-handed?"

### #575 He had a hat!

[My thanks to Michael West for this version of ‘he had a hat’]

Becky and Myron decided to take their little son from the heat of the city to his first visit to the beach. Dressed in his little sailor suit and hat and pail and shovel in hand, the boy happily played at the water's edge as his mother and father spread their picnic blanket. Then suddenly, to his parents' horror, a huge wave crashed down on the boy and then dragged him far out to sea. As neither of his parents could swim, his mother began to wail and cry, "Dear God, be merciful. Return our son to us!"

Suddenly another huge wave cast the boy back up on the sand at his parents' feet. His mother inspected her son and then quickly looked back towards the heavens and said, "He had a hat!"

### #576 So who’s kidding who?

Maurice and Rifka are a lovely elderly couple, both in their eighties. One day, Rifka says to Maurice, “Do you know what I’d like right now - an ice cream.”

“Then I’ll go get you one,” says Maurice.

“That’s sweet of you, dear,” says Rifka. “Go get a piece of paper so you can write down what I want. You know how bad your memory is these days.”

“Don’t you worry,” says Maurice, “I won’t forget – just tell me what you want.”

“I’d rather you wrote it down,” says Rifka.

“Please don’t argue,” says Maurice, “what do you want?”

“I want a cornet with one scoop of raspberry ice cream. Please write it down.”

“I don’t need to. Do you want anything else?” says Maurice.

“Yes, I’ll also have a scoop of chocolate ice cream,” replies Rifka.

“Anything else?” says Maurice.

“Yes, I’ll have some butterscotch sauce on top of the ice cream. But are you sure you won’t write it down?” says Rifka.

“I don’t need to, honest.  Now do you want anything else?” says Maurice.

“Well now you ask,” says Rifka, “I’d like a sprinkling of nuts over the sauce and to finish it off, a glace cherry on top. But will you remember all of that?”

“Yes, dear, stop nagging,” says Maurice and leaves to get the order.

50 minutes later Maurice comes back with a parcel. He goes straight to Rifka and proudly announces, “Darling, here’s the fried fish you asked for!”

Rifka looks in the parcel, then at him and says, “I knew you would forget something. So where are the chips?”

### #578 A Trip to the Old Country

Benjamin, a young Talmud student who had left Israel for London some years earlier, returns to visit his family.

"But Benjamin, where is your beard?" asks his mother upon seeing him.

"Mother," he replies, "In London, nobody wears a beard."

"But at least you keep the Sabbath?" his mother asks.

"Mother, business is business. In London, everybody works on the Sabbath."

"But kosher food you still eat?" asks his mother.

"Mother, in London, it is very difficult to keep kosher."

Then silence, whilst his elderly mother gives thought to what she has just heard. Then she leans over and whispers in his ear, "Benjamin, tell me, are you still circumcised?"

### #579 A visit to the doctor

Abe comes home one day and finds his wife Esther in tears.

"Darling, what’s the matter?"

"Oh Abe," cries Esther, "Doctor Cohen says I have tuberculosis."

"What! A big healthy woman like you has tuberculosis? Ridiculous," says Abe, "I'll call Doctor Cohen and get this sorted out right now."

So Abe calls his doctor. "Doctor, Esther says you told her she has tuberculosis."

The doctor says something to Abe and with that, Abe begins laughing.

"So what's so funny about my having such a dreadful disease?" asks Esther.

"Esther, Doctor Cohen didn't say 'tuberculosis', he said 'too big a toches’"

Gary stood over his tee shot for what seemed like an eternity. He looked up, looked down, measured the distance, figured the wind direction and speed. Then he started over again. All this was driving his partner Benny nuts.

Finally Benny said, "Oy vey! What's taking you so long? Hit the blasted ball will you already!"

Gary replied, "But Benny, my wife Suzie is up there watching me from the clubhouse. I want to make this a perfect shot."

### #582 The prophecy

Moishe, a medieval Jewish astrologer, prophesied that the king’s favourite mistress would soon die. Sure enough, the woman died a short time later. The king was outraged at the astrologer, certain that his prophecy had brought about the woman's death. He summoned Moishe and commanded him, "Prophecy, tell me when you will die!"

Moishe realized that the king was planning to kill him immediately, no matter what answer he gave. "I do not know when I will die," he answered finally. "I only know that whenever I die, the king will die three days later."

### #583 Shaggy buffalo story

A family of Schmohawk Indians were sitting around the fire one night. There was papa Geronowitz, mama Pocayenta and the beautiful daughter, Minihorowitz.

"So, nu," says Minihorowitz, "You'll never believe."

"What?" says Pocayenta.

"Today, at high noon, someone proposed to me."

"So what did you say?" says Pocayenta."

"I said yes"

"That's wonderful," says Pocayenta. "She said yes! Did you hear that Geronowitz? Our little Minihorowitz is getting married."

"I heard," says Geronowitz, "I'm kvelling. So who's the lucky boy?"

"Sittin' Bialy."

"Sittin' Bialy?" says Pocayenta," of the SoSiouxMe tribe?"

"That's the one," says Minihorowitz.

"Oy, Geronowitz! The SoSiouxMe's! There are so many of them. How can we feed them? How can we get them all in our teepee for the wedding?"

"We'll think of something," says Geronowitz.

"Geronowitz, get me a buffalo for the wedding. I can make buffalo tzimmes from the meat and we can make an extra teepee from the hide. Get me a buffalo."

So Geronowitz goes out to hunt a buffalo. A day and night goes by and Geronowitz has not come back. Another day and half the night and Geronowitz comes home exhausted, staggering and empty-handed.

"Geronowitz I've been worried sick. Where have you been? Where's my buffalo?"

"It's like this," he says. "On my first day out, I hunted high and I hunted low and I finally found a buffalo. But this buffalo was scrawny with no meat on his bones for buffalo tzimmes and barely enough hide for a rain hat. So I settled in for the night to try again the next day.

The second day, I looked high and I looked low, from this way and that way and I finally found a buffalo. He was big with lots of meat and lots of hide, but I tell you, Pocayenta, this was the ugliest buffalo I ever saw in my life. This, I thought to myself, is not the buffalo for my daughter's wedding. So I carried on looking. I went up hills and I went down hills and I found a big buffalo. It was, as buffaloes go, a beautiful buffalo. If I say so myself, it was  the perfect buffalo. This, I said to myself, is the buffalo Pocayenta wants for Minihorowitz's wedding.

So I reach into my backpack quietly for my tomahawk as I tip-toe over to the buffalo. I raise my tomahawk slowly over the buffalo's neck when suddenly, like a bolt of lightning from the sky, I see it."

"See what?" says Pocayenta.

"I've brought the dairy tomahawk!"

### #584 Well trained

Sam invites Issy to see how his dog Cindy is getting on with her obedience training. Issy says, "Why not get Cindy to do a trick for me?"

Sam says, " Cindy, fetch."

Cindy immediately starts to whine and says, "Oy! What a terrible day I'm having, you wouldn't believe it could get any worse. And the food he’s giving me, well, it’s not even fit for a dog, it’s rubbish. And he wouldn’t even take me out for my daily exercise this morning."

Issy doesn't understand why Cindy should behave in this way. So Sam explains, "Cindy hasn’t got the best of hearing these days. She thought I said kvetch."

Daniel and Hette are out shopping in London when they come across a smart clothes shop. Hette goes in.

While Daniel is waiting outside, a prostitute comes up to him and says, "Would you like to come back to my place?"

Being a bit of a joker, Daniel decides to string her along. He replies, "How much do you charge?"

"One hundred pounds," she says.

"I'll give you ten pounds," Daniel says with a wink.

She gives him the V sign and walks away.

Hette comes out the shop and they continue their shopping expedition. But then they pass the prostitute on the corner of the road. She takes one look at Hette and says to Daniel, "You see? You see what you get for ten pounds?"

### #587 One over the minyan

Nine male Jews are very nice, but as we all know, ten are needed for a minyan. So when the tenth person arrives, everyone is happy. But did you know that the eleventh Jew is also very important? Why is this so?

When the eleventh person enters, someone is always heard to say aloud, "Thank goodness."

The eleventh arrival always responds, "But you had a minyan already."

To which comes the reply, "You make the 'pisher' and now I can leave the room and go to the bathroom!"

### #588 The message

[My thanks to Debbe of Boston for sending me this one]

Morris was in his front garden mowing the lawn when his attractive blonde neighbour came out of her house and went straight to her mailbox. She opened it then slammed it shut and stormed back into the house.

A little later, she came out of her house again, went to her mailbox, opened it, slammed it shut and went angrily back into the house.

A few minutes later, she came out again, marched to her mailbox, opened it and then slammed it shut harder than ever.

Puzzled by her actions, Morris had to ask her, "Is something wrong, Sharon?"

"There certainly is, Morris! My stupid computer keeps saying, "YOU'VE GOT MAIL."

### #589 Holiday of a lifetime

A north London congregation decides to honour their Rabbi for his 25 years of dedicated service by giving him tickets and money for a week, all-expenses paid holiday to New York.

When Rabbi Bloom arrives and checks into his hotel room, he is surprised to find a naked girl lying face down on his bed. Without saying a word, Rabbi Bloom picks up the phone, calls his synagogue long distance and says, "Where is your respect? As your Rabbi, I am very, very angry with you."

On hearing this, the girl gets up and starts to get dressed.

Rabbi Bloom turns to her and says, "Where are you going? I'm not angry with you."

### #590 And they lived happily ever after

Shlomo and Ruth were celebrating their golden wedding anniversary. Their long lasting and happy marriage was the talk of the Edgware community. So it was no surprise when a Jewish Chronicle reporter came to see Shlomo to ask him the secret of their successful marriage.

"Well, it dates back to our honeymoon," explained Shlomo. "We visited the Grand Canyon and took a trip down to the bottom of the canyon on mules. We hadn't gone very far when Ruth’s mule stumbled. She looked at the mule and quietly said 'That's once.'

"We had only proceeded a little farther when the mule stumbled again. Once more Ruth looked him in the eyes and quietly said, 'That's twice.'

"We hadn't gone more than a half-mile more when the mule stumbled a third time. This time, Ruth promptly removed a revolver from her rucksack and shot the mule dead.

"I started to protest over her treatment of the mule when Ruth looked at me and quietly said, 'That's once'."

"Would you like a new diamond bracelet?" he asks.

"Not really," says Naomi.

"Well how about a Lexus sports car?" says Jeremy.

"No," she replies.

"What about a holiday home in the south of France?" he suggests.

She again rejects his offer with a "No thanks."

"Well what would you like for your anniversary?" Jeremy asks.

"I'd like a divorce, Jeremy," answers Naomi.

"Oy, I wasn't planning to spend that much!" says Jeremy.

(My thanks to Hilary from Melbourne, Australia for the following joke)

Sadie, an elderly lady, is sitting at home one day when her phone rings.

She picks it up and says, “Hello.”

A male voice says, “Hello. I can tell from your voice that you would love me to come round to your house, take off your blouse, bra and panties, throw you onto your bed and make mad passionate love to you.”

Sadie replies, “From one ‘hello’ you can tell all this?”

"Sorry to hear that Moishe." said Sam. "May I ask why?"

"I found her supply of birth control pills." said Moishe.

### #598 Visit to the chemist

(My thanks to Charles K. for the following joke)

Moshe, 85 years old and recently arrived in the UK from Russia, is walking down Golders Green Road one day when he sees his cousin Max coming towards him.  Max is smoking a cigarette using a cigarette holder. As Moshe had never seen such a thing before, he asks, “Vats duss, Max?”

“Dots a protector, Moshe,” replies Max. “It protects mine clothing from di eshes and mine beard from di flame.”

Moshe says, “I gotta hev one a dem, too. Where you geddit?”

Max replies, “I got it from a chemist.”

So Moshe shuffles down the road till he comes to a chemist. He goes up to the assistant and says, “So gimme a protector.”

The assistant looks at the little wizened old man and decides to have some fun with him. “So what size do you want, mister?”

Moshe shrugs his shoulders and replies, “Size? It should fit a cemel”

### #599 Really?

Sadie takes her 16-year-old daughter to see Doctor Myers. The doctor says, "Okay, what's the problem?"

Sadie says, "It's my daughter, Sarah. She keeps getting these cravings, she's putting on weight, and is sick most mornings."

The doctor gives Sarah a good examination, then turns to Sadie and says, "Well, I don't know how to tell you this, but your Sarah is pregnant - about 4 months would be my guess."

Sadie says, "Pregnant? She can't be, she has never ever been left alone with a man! Have you, Sarah?"

"No mother. I've never even kissed a man."

Doctor Myers walked over to the window and just stared out of it. 5 minutes pass and finally Sadie says, "Is there something wrong out there doctor?"

Doctor Myers replies, "No, not really, it's just that the last time anything like this happened, a star appeared in the east and three wise men came over the hill. I certainly don’t want to miss it."

### #600 The visitor

Moishe and Sadie, hoping to get rid of their Rabbi, decided to trap him by exposing his hypocrisy when his wife went to Israel to visit her family. The Rabbi was working at home, as he usually did on Wednesday mornings, preparing his Shabbat sermon, when the doorbell rang. When he opened the door, there was Sadie standing outside. She opened her coat, revealing that she was nude, except for a small frilly white apron.

"Do you want to play games?" Sadie asked, "I'll be Caron, the French maid."

"Wonderful, wonderful," the Rabbi said, "come right in and take off your coat."

He looked Sadie over and said, "OK, let's play. You're the maid and I'm the housewife. I'm going out to have lunch with a couple of my friends, and while I’m gone, you're going to start in the kitchen. Be careful with the crockery and don't mix up the silverware. OK?"

### #601 Very careful studies

Last year, as some German scientists were digging 150 feet under the ground, they were surprised to discover small pieces of copper. They studied the copper pieces very carefully and came to the conclusion that 25,000 years ago, there was a nationwide telephone network in ancient Germany. They reported this in scientific journals, world-wide.

When British scientists heard the German announcement, they were just not impressed. They immediately embarked on a project to dig even deeper. When they had dug down to 300 feet, they found small pieces of glass. They studied the glass pieces very carefully and came to the conclusion that 35,000 years ago, there was a nationwide fibre optic network in use by the ancient Brits.

Israeli scientists were enraged when they learned of the German and British claims. They decided to dig 150 feet, 300 feet and 600 feet under the ground in Jerusalem. But unfortunately, they found nothing whatsoever. Nevertheless, they came to the conclusion that 55,000 years ago, the ancient Israelites had cellular telephones.

### #602 The check-up

Maurice was 70 years old and makes an appointment to see his doctor. His doctor asks him a few questions.

"Mr Levy, what about urination? Do you have any problems?"

Maurice replies, "No doctor, it’s very regular, every morning at precisely 7am."

"And what about your bowel movements?"

Maurice replies, "They’re fine also doctor, every morning at precisely 8am."

The doctor asks, "So then why did you come to see me, Mr Levy?"

Maurice replies, "Oy, doctor, I don’t wake up before 10am."

### #603 The argument

Abe, David and Bernard were not only best of friends but also the top doctors in the neighbourhood. One day, they were out walking in Golders Green when they saw this little old Jewish man walking rather strangely. He's hunched over on one side, he’s dragging his right leg and he has his left hand on his lower back.

Abe says, "It's peritonitis."

David says, "It's an orthopaedic problem, with flat arches and a touch of chondromalacia patellae."

Bernard says, "It's a nerve irritation at the level of L5."

They argue a bit and then decide to go over and ask the old man what his problem is. So they do just that.

The man replies, "Nein. ICH HOB GEVOLT GEBBEN A FURZT HOB ICH INGEMACHT IN DER HOYSEN"

(You're all wrong. I thought I was about to fart when I made in my pants instead)

### #604 The visit to the chemist

One day, the elderly Moshe decided to go to his local chemist and ask the pharmacist for some Viagra.

The pharmacist said, "Certainly sir, how many pills do you want?"

Moshe answered, "I don’t want many, maybe half a dozen at most. But please, can you cut each one into 4 pieces?"

The pharmacist said, "one quarter of a pill won't do you any good, sir."

Moshe replies, "That's OK. I don't need the pills for sex. I am 75 years old. I just want them to help me to stop peeing on my shoes."

### #606 The 7 fridges

It might not be known by many outside of Israel but new immigrants can bring in normal household items duty free, but anything that looks like it could be resold in Israel is supposed to be subject to Israeli import duty.

Moshe Cohen, a new immigrant, arrived at the Port of Haifa to claim his household goods, which had just been landed by ship. However, when he turned up, he was immediately called into the Port offices because the excise officer had noticed on the manifest that Moshe had brought in seven refrigerators.

"Mr Cohen," said the officer, "one refrigerator is allowed duty free, but certainly not seven of them."

Moshe replied, "But I'm very frum. I need one refrigerator just for meat, one just for dairy, and one just for parve."

"OK," said the officer, "that makes three, but what about the other four?"

"It’s obvious," replied Moshe, "I need three for most of the year and another three, for meat, dairy and parve, for Pesach."

"That only makes six," replied the officer," What's the seventh one for?"

"So nu," replied Moshe, "What if I want to eat traif once in a while?"

### #607 The tramp

Shlomo was walking down Hendon High Street one day when a filthy looking and smelly tramp came up to him and asked, “Could you spare one pound, please mister?”

Shlomo replied, "Will you buy alcohol with it?"

The tramp answered, "No, certainly not. I don’t drink."

Shlomo then asked, "Will you gamble it away?"

The tramp again replied, "No, I don’t gamble."

So Shlomo said to the tramp, "OK, I’ll give you your pound, but first of all you have to come home with me so my wife Becky can see what happens to a man who doesn't drink or gamble?"

### #608 The message

Jacob was an uneducated but hard-working immigrant who wanted a better future for his only son, David. He scrimped and saved for David’s school education. In return, David worked hard and got accepted at a small school far from home.

Every month, David received a cheque from his father for his living expenses and every month, the cheque was attached to a piece of paper with the letters 'FUF' written on it. It regularly puzzled David, but he cashed the cheques anyway and went about his studies. Finally Passover came and David was able to travel home.

As he sat with his father after the Seder, David said, "Dad, I want you to know how much I love you and how much I appreciate everything you're doing for me. I really couldn't get by without the cheque you send me every month. But I must ask, what does it mean when you write 'FUF'?"

His father replied, "Oy, some scholar you’re not. 'FUF' means 'From U Fadder'."

### #609 A restful event

Natalie had three very active sons and they were quite a handful. One summer evening she was playing cowboys and Indians with them in her front garden when one of the boys "shot" her and shouted "Bang! You're dead, mum."

So Natalie fell down.

Her next door neighbour had been watching all this and when Natalie didn't get up straight away, he ran over to see if she had been hurt in the fall.

When the neighbour bent over her, Natalie opened one eye and said to him, "Shhh. Please don't give me away. It's the only chance I've had to have a rest all day".

### #610 The composer

Once upon a time, a young Jewish composer was trying desperately to write a hit song. He had been at it for an entire day, without food or water, but the inspiration was taking a long time coming.

Then his mother came into his room and said, “You must eat something. I’ll make you a smoked salmon sandwich.”

But he pushed her out of the room, shouting, “Go away.”

Within 15 minutes, she was back. “Please, you must eat some food or you’ll be ill,” she cried.

Again he shoved her out of the room, this time shouting, “Will you please leave me alone, you silly moo. Stop bothering me, will you.”

But she took no notice. Ten minutes later, she came into the room carrying a tray full of food and drink. All his favourites were there.

But it had no effect on him. She was still holding the tray of food when he angrily threw her out of the room and locked the door.  He heard the crash of the tray hitting the wall and the sound of breaking chinaware. Then he heard his mother crying. Suddenly, he shouted, “I’ve got it, I know what to write.”

With that he went to his piano and composed ‘My Yiddishe Mama’.

### #611 Woman

Adam was bored in the Garden of Eden, so he says to God, “O Lord, I have a problem.”

“So what is your problem Adam?” replies God.

“O Lord, I know that you did create me and gave me all this wonderful food and put me in this beautiful garden, but I'm just not happy.”

“Why is that, Adam?“

“O Lord, even though I know you created this place for me and you gave me all these beautiful animals to be with, I am nevertheless still lonely.“

“OK Adam, I have the perfect solution - I shall create a woman for you.“

“What is a 'woman', O Lord?“

“A ‘woman' will be such an intelligent creature that she will know what you want before you ask for it. She will be so sensitive and caring that she will know your every mood and how to make you happy. Her beauty will be the equal of anything on earth. She will unquestioningly care for your every need and desire. She will be the ideal companion.“ answers the voice from heaven.“

“This woman sounds great to me, O Lord.“

“She will be, take my word for it, but she comes at a price, Adam.“

“So how much will she cost me, O Lord?“ Adam asks.

“She will cost you your left arm, your right foot, one eye, one ear and your

right testicle.“

Adam thinks about this for a good 60 minutes, working out all the pros and cons of having such a woman for company, but especially the cost to him.

Finally Adam says, “O Lord, what kind of woman can I get for just one rib?“

The rest, as they say, is history.

### #612 Shlomo and Rifka – 1 (the honeymoon)

Shlomo and Rifka had just got married and were on honeymoon. On the first night, as he was making love to Rifka for the first time, Shlomo looked down at her and asked, "Am I the first man to make love to you, Rifka?"

Rifka looked up at him and replied, "No Shlomo. I'm sure I would have recognised you."

### #613 Shlomo and Rifka – 2 (the golden wedding anniversary)

Shlomo and Rifka had now been married for 50 years and that night, after the celebrations were over, they were in bed and in a pretty romantic mood.

Rifka looked at Shlomo and said, "I remember when you used to kiss me every chance you had."

Shlomo felt a bit obliged, so he leaned over and gave her a gentle peck on the cheek.

Then Rifka said, "I also remember, Shlomo, when you used to hold my hand at every opportunity."

Again feeling obliged, Shlomo gently placed his hand on hers.

Then Rifka said, "I also remember, Shlomo, when you used to nibble on my neck and sent chills up and down my spine. It was lovely."

This time, with a blank stare on his face, Shlomo got out of the bed and as he began to walk out of the bedroom, Rifka asked him, "Was it something I said, Shlomo, where are you going?"

Shlomo looked at Rifka and replied, "I'm going to the bathroom to get my teeth!"

Six retired Edgware men were playing poker one evening in Abe’s house when Shlomo loses £650 on one big hand, clutches his chest and drops dead at the table. The other five continue playing but this time standing up to show respect for their departed friend.

Later, Abe asks, "Who's going to tell his wife, Hette?"

They cut cards and Moishe loses. Before he leaves, he is advised to be discreet and kind and to try hard not to make a terrible situation any worse.

"Discreet?" says Moishe, "I'm the most discreet man there is. Discretion is my middle name. Just leave it to me and don’t worry about a thing."

So Moishe goes over to Shlomo’s house and rings the doorbell.

Hette opens the door and asks, "Nu, so what do you want?"

Moishe replies, "Your husband just lost £650 and is afraid to come home."

On hearing this, Hette yells, "SO TELL HIM HE SHOULD DROP DEAD."

"OK I'll go tell him," says Moishe.

Rifka goes to her son's house and rings the doorbell. When the maid lets her in, she is surprised to find her daughter-in-law Sarah lying on the couch, totally naked. Soft music is playing and the aroma of expensive perfume fills the air.

"Sarah, what are you doing?" Rifka asks.

"I'm waiting for David to come home from work," replies Sarah.

"But you're naked!" says Rifka.

"I know," says Sarah, "this is my love dress. David loves me to wear this dress. It excites him no end.  Every time he sees me in this dress, he instantly becomes virile and makes love to me for hours on end. Why don’t you try it with Benjy?"

Rifka goes home, undresses, has a bath and puts on her best perfume. Then, still naked, she dims the lights, puts on a romantic CD and lay on the settee waiting for Benjy to arrive.

Benjy comes home and sees Rifka laying there, ever so provocatively.

"What on earth are you doing, Rifka?" he asks.

"This is my love dress," she whispers, sensually.

"It needs ironing," he says.

### #618 Visit to the cemetery

Moshe went to Edgware cemetery to visit his friend Daniel’s grave. When he got there, he was shocked to see that Daniel’s new headstone was leaning forward by some 45 degrees and could topple over. So Moshe took some wire from his car, tied one end around the headstone and fastened the other end onto a nearby telephone pole. Then he left.

Some days later, two more of Daniel’s friends, Abe and Issy came to visit him. Abe took one look at the grave and said to Issy, “That’s just like Daniel. He’s only been here a short while and already he’s got his own phone.”

### #619 The homework

Little Moishe is busy doing his homework. As his mother walks past his room, she hears him saying, "One and one, the son-of-a-bitch is two. Two and two, the son-of-a-bitch is four. Three and three... "

So she asks him, "Darling, where did you learn that way of doing sums?"

Moishe replies, "My teacher, Miss Anderson, taught us that way, mummy."

Next day, Moishe’s mother goes into his classroom, confronts Miss Anderson and tells her about Moishe’s ‘different’ way of doing arithmetic.

Miss Anderson is shocked. At first she can’t understand why Moishe would say that she had taught it, but then suddenly it dawned on her.

"I know why," she says, "in our class, we say, one and one, the sum of which is two….."

### #620 Conversation with a taxi driver

Abe was visiting Israel for the first time. As soon as his plane landed, he got a taxi to take him to his hotel. The taxi driver was very friendly and told Abe all kinds of useful information.

Then Abe asks the driver, "Say, is Israel a healthy place?"

"Oh, yes, it really is," the driver answered, "When I first came here, I couldn't say even one simple word, I had hardly any hair on my head, I didn't have the energy to walk across a small room and I even had to be helped out of bed every day."

"That's a remarkable story, truly amazing," Abe said, "so how long have you been here in Israel?"

"I was born here."

### #621 Use of hands

Issy and Sam, both elderly gentlemen, were in deep conversation. Sam said, "So, Issy, you’re the clever one, how do those so called mobile phones work?"

Issy replied, "Well, in the left hand you take the phone, and with the right hand you push the buttons. See. Nothing magic about it is there?"

But Sam was not satisfied with this answer.

"Nu?" he says, "and how can one talk with the hands so busy?"

### #622 Change of Name

In Golders Green there is a six-star hotel called the Oy Vay Towers. It offers massage, mud baths, 24 hours a day kosher eating, wonderful almond Danish and best of all, g-o-s-s-i-p. The hotel pages its guests via high quality, clear sounding speakers sited all around the hotel. Listening to messages such as "Telephone call for Moishe Cohen from his lawyer," or "Could Sadie Levy ring her counsellor,” or even “Benny Chesnick – could you please call your parole officer," is a gossiper’s dream.

One day, everyone was surprised to hear over the speakers, "Telephone call for Shane Ferguson, telephone call for Shane Ferguson." At once, several people went to reception to get a look at who this gentile staying at their hotel could be. They were therefore surprised and very curious when an old man, obviously Jewish, came up to the desk.

Later, one of the guests asked the old man how he came to be named Shane Ferguson when he was so obviously Jewish. This is what he told them.

"When I left my home town to come to London, my name was Samuel Mincoffski. But my uncle thought it might be best if I told immigration that my name was Sam Lyons. I practiced saying my new name over and over for the entire boat trip. I asked the sailors to say it for me and I learned how to pronounce it. Time passed very quickly and soon I was standing in line at the immigration office. But while waiting, I began to worry about everything. Would I say my name properly? What if they wouldn’t believe me? Would I be able to spell it? Would they arrest me and send me back? My mind started to spin and I got so confused that when I reached the front of the queue and the officer asked me my name, I panicked and said, “schane fergessen” (I forgot already). So that's what the immigration man wrote down.”

### #623 The house warming

Morris had become a multi-millionaire during his successful working life. When he retired, he bought himself the largest and most expensive mansion in London that money could buy. Then he invited some friends to a house warming party.

The day came and he naturally took them on a tour around his enormous home.

When they came to the dining room, there was a gasp of amazement - the room was so large that they could hardly see the other end clearly. Morris proudly pointed to the exquisitely carved and polished mahogany table that ran from one end of the room all the way to the other and said, "In this room, I can entertain as many as a hundred and twenty-five people -- God forbid."

---

### #624 Why buy?

It was a hot day. Moshe was sitting in Brent Cross shopping centre drinking from a bottle of Evian water when his friend Benny came over and sat next to him.

Benny looked at the bottle in Moshe’s hand and asked, “Do you ever wonder why people spend almost £1 on such little bottles of water?”

“No,” replied Moshe.

“Well,” continued Benny, “Try spelling Evian backwards.”

### #628  Gnilleps

Grandma Anne was babysitting and was playing junior scrabble with Emma. Emma had just drawn her second letter "O" and was trying to make a word with the other letters she had. Suddenly, with a triumphant shout, Emma said, "look grandma, I’ve made a word."

Grandma Anne looked at Emma’s tiles and saw they had been lined up to spell KOOB. So she asked, "What kind of word is KOOB, Emma?"

"No grandma," said Emma, "you're not saying it right. It says BOOK."

Grandma Anne had a sinking feeling. Did Emma have dyslexia, she wondered? So she said, gently, "But, darling, you've spelled it backwards."

With a sigh reserved only for dumb adults, Emma explained, "Of course I have, grandma, I'm Jewish!"

### #629 Mistaken identity

Issy and Hetty, a young orthodox married couple, were expecting their first baby. Unfortunately, Hetty’s water broke on Shabbos and they had no choice but to call for a taxi to take them to the hospital’s maternity ward. Because Issy wanted to try and minimise the Shabbos violation, he told the controller that he must send them only a non-Jewish driver.

The taxi quickly arrived, but when Issy and Hetty were getting in, they overheard the controller on the two-way radio ask the driver, “Have you picked up the anti-semites yet?”

### #630 Don’t be impatient

Arnold and Isaac were residents in a nursing home. Even though they were best of friends, they were still prone to argue with each other.

One day, they are queuing up at the canteen to get their lunch. Because Arnold is taking his time, Isaac says to him, "Hey you! Hurry up already before I punch you in the teeth."

Arnold turns round, looks at Isaac and says, "OK. Go ahead. Make my day! My teeth are upstairs in the glass by my bed."

### #631 The budget

Helen and Issy were having a hard time financially and needed to keep their spending to a minimum. To keep her household account as low as she could, Helen decided not to have her dress dry-cleaned. Instead, she washed it by hand. When Issy returned from work, Helen proudly told him of her idea to save money.

She said, "Just think, Issy, we are £3 richer because I washed this dress by hand."

"Great," Issy quickly replied. "Wash it again!"

### #632 Get stuck in

When the air raid siren went off in Tel Aviv, Hannah rushed down the stairs toward the basement of their apartment block. Isaac was much slower so she stopped and shouted back up the stairs, "Come on, Isaac, get moving will you?"

Isaac shouted down to her, "Wait a minute, Hannah. I’m looking for my teeth."

"Never mind your silly teeth, Isaac," Hannah shouted back, "what do you think they’ll drop on us – smoked salmon bagels?"

### #635 Another visit to the doctor

(My thanks to Danny S for the following joke)

Benjy goes to see his doctor because he isn't feeling too well. After examining him, the doctor takes some samples from Benjy and asks him to come back the following week for the results.

When Benjy returns, his doctor tells him, "I have some good news and some bad news for you, Benjy. What do you want to hear first?"

Benjy replies, "Let me have the good news first."

"OK," says the doctor, "they're going to name the disease after you."

### #636 Finally Together

Sadie is a beautiful girl. She could have been an actress but instead she decides to get married young and raise a large family. In no time at all she has ten children. Then suddenly her husband passes away - and Sadie is still only 42.

But it doesn’t take our Sadie long to find a new husband. She quickly remarries and finds happiness once more. She could have decided that ten children was enough, but instead has eight more by her new husband. He dies when Sadie is still only 64 years old.

Maybe having so many children took it out on Sadie’s poor body because only a few months later, Sadie herself passes away. At her funeral, the Rabbi looks skyward and says, "At last they're finally together."

Sadie’s eldest son says, "Rabbi, do you mean mum and my father, or mum and my stepfather?"

The Rabbi replies, "Neither. I mean her legs."

### #637 The special guest

Moshe spent the week looking unsuccessfully around north London for a place to live. Now it was erev shabbos and he is alone in a strange town. He finds the local shul and after services explains his predicament to the shammas. Within minutes, Jacob comes over and invites him to be his shabbos guest.

At Jacob’s house, Moshe is given towels and aromatic soap and then shown to the bathroom. After a soothing hot bath, he dries himself on the soft fluffy towel, gets dressed and joins Jacob and his wife for a delicious meal. He is then shown to his bedroom where he immediately falls asleep.

The same kindness is shown to Moshe the next day. On Sunday it’s time to leave and Moshe tells Jacob, "This was a lovely shabbos. How can I ever repay you?"

"By paying me," replies Jacob and gives Moshe an invoice for: -

### #638 Forgetfulness

One Friday morning, a letter dropped through Rabbi Bloom’s letterbox. He opened it and took out a single sheet of paper. On it was written just one word: "SCHMUCK"

Next day, at the end of his shabbos sermon, Rabbi Bloom announced to his congregation, "I have previously come across people who have written to me but forgot to sign the letter. This week, however, I received a letter from someone who signed it but forgot to write the letter."

### #640 The curse

Rifka goes to see a famous Wizard and asks, "Is it possible to remove a curse I’ve been living with for the last 35 years?"

The Wizard replies, "It’s possible, but you must tell me the exact words that were used to put the curse on you in the first place."

Rifka says, "I now pronounce you man and wife".

### #641 The Barmitzvah

Issy wanted something extra special and memorable for his son Paul’s Barmitzvah. He spent weeks checking out the swankiest venues and the best caterers in London and then settled on a very plush banqueting hall and an enormously expensive caterer who promised him a great surprise on the night.

“Issy,” said the caterer, “don’t worry. It will be such a special event that everyone who attends will talk about it for years to come.”

“OK, where do I sign?” said Issy.

The night of Paul’s Barmitzvah party arrived. As soon as everyone was seated, the lights dimmed and to a fanfare from Sam Bloom’s Symphony Orchestra, 12 powerful searchlights shone upwards whilst at the same time, an uncannily lifelike model of Paul slowly descended from the ceiling. But this was no ordinary sculpture. It was made entirely out of chopped liver.

From all over the hall could be heard gasps of amazement. Then the toastmaster announced that the sculpture had been created by the great Henry Moore himself. Everyone cheered.

At the end of the affair, Issy met with the caterer to settle the bill.

"This was indeed a very special night for me," Issy said, "but one thing upset me. Did you really have to get that gentile Henry Moore to make the statue? Why didn’t you get a Jew? Couldn’t you have asked, say, Epstein?"

"Well, to tell you the truth," said the caterer, "I did ask Epstein, but he only works in egg and onion."

### #642 On a tube train

Shlomo is travelling on the London underground and is sitting opposite a middle aged Jew wearing a kippah. Shlomo says, "Shalom. Do you have the time?"

The man ignores him.

"Excuse me," Shlomo asks again, "what time is it please?"

The man still doesn't answer him.

"Sir, forgive me for interrupting you again, but I need to know the time. Why won't you answer me?"

At last the man speaks. "Son, the next stop is Edgware, the last station on this line. I haven’t seen you before so you must be a stranger. If I answer you now, it’s Jewish tradition that I must invite you to my home. As you're young and good looking and I have a beautiful daughter named Suzy, you will fall in love with her and will want to get married. So tell me, why on earth would I want a son-in-law who can't even afford his own watch?"

### #643 The perfect match?

A matchmaker corners a poor student and says, "Do I have a girl for you!"

"I’m not interested," replies the student.

"But she's a very beautiful girl," says the matchmaker.

"Really?" says the student, a bit more interested now.

"Yes. And she's also very rich."

"Are you serious?"

"Of course I am. Would I lie to you? And she has a long line of ancestry. She comes from a very noble family."

"It all sounds great to me," says the student, "but why would a girl like that want to marry me? She'd have to be crazy."

Replies the matchmaker, "Well, you can't have everything in life!"

### #644 Happiness

It was Hetty and Benjy’s Silver Wedding anniversary.

Hetty says, "Do you remember when you proposed to me, Benjy? I was so overwhelmed and taken aback that I couldn’t talk for an hour."

### #645 Decisions, decisions

It was coming up to Morris’s 80th birthday and his family didn't know what to buy him - he was a man who really had everything. After much discussion, they decided to hire a strip-o-gram. He had a good sense of humour and they thought he would enjoy the joke.

On the morning of his birthday, the doorbell rang. Morris opened the door and there stood a beautiful redhead wearing only black gloves and thigh-length boots.

"Happy Birthday Morris," she said. "Do you know why I’m here?"

"No," said Morris.

"Well, I've come here to give you ‘super sex’," she said provocatively.

Just for a brief moment, Morris looked a bit confused, but then said, "You’ve given me a difficult decision to make - what kind of soup is it?"

### #646 A trip to the garage

Rifka was the original ‘Jewish princess’. One day, she drives her pink Renault Clio to a garage and asks one of the mechanics, "Do you charge batteries?"

### #647 The alligator shoes

Moshe had always wanted a pair of alligator shoes but had never been able to afford them. One day he sees a pair in the Selfridges Sale priced at only £39.99. He couldn’t believe it. They even had his size. So he buys them and proudly wears them to go home.

When he gets home, he stands in front of his wife and says, "Sadie, do you notice anything different about me?"

She looks him up and down and says, "Moshe, you look the same to me. You’re wearing the same shirt you wore yesterday and the same trousers. So you tell me, what’s different?"

But Moshe won’t give up easily. He goes into the bedroom, undresses and comes out completely naked, other than his new shoes.

Once again he stands in front of Sadie and says, "Sadie, now do you notice anything different about me?"

Once again she looks him up and down, then says, "Moshe, it looks the same to me. It's hanging down just as it was hanging down yesterday. No doubt it will be still hanging down tomorrow."

Angrily, Moishe says, "Do you know why it’s hanging down, Sadie? It’s hanging down because it’s looking directly at my new shoes!"

Sadie replies, "Moshe, I wish you had bought a new hat!"

### #648 Two Jewish curses

### #649 The fishermen

Issy had read that fishing was a therapeutic pastime. So he buys the necessary equipment and goes to his local lake. But as it's his first time, he has no idea what bait to use. He looks around and sees 3 men casting their lines. Almost immediately, they began to catch an awful lot of fish. So Issy goes up to them.

"Excuse me," he asks the first man, "What bait are you using?"

"Well, I'm a doctor and I use tonsils," he replies. "You really can't beat them – the fish here love tonsils."

Well Issy hasn’t bought any tonsils with him, so he goes to the second fisherman.

"Excuse me," he asks, "What bait are you using?"

"I'm also a doctor and I have a great deal of success using bits of appendix."

Issy then turns to the third fisherman and can’t help but notice that he too is very successful at catching fish.

"Let me guess," Issy says to him. "You're also a doctor."

"Actually I’m not," came the reply. "I'm a mohel."

### #650 The anniversary

Shlomo asks his wife, "Where shall we go to celebrate our anniversary, darling?"

Sarah replies, "Somewhere I have never been!"

So Shlomo says, "How about the kitchen, then?"

### #651 The note

Howard had been a good Jew all his life. Now, 90 years old, he was very ill and in hospital. His family were with him. Then his Rabbi arrived.

As the Rabbi walked up to the bed, Howard 's condition began to deteriorate and he motioned frantically for something to write on. When the Rabbi gave him a pencil and a piece of paper, Howard used his last ounce of energy to write a short note. Then he died.

The Rabbi placed the note in his jacket pocket and said prayers.

Later, at Howard’s funeral, as the Rabbi was finishing the eulogy, he suddenly remembered the note.

"I’ve just remembered," said the Rabbi to those present, "that Howard handed me a note just before he died. I haven't looked at it yet, but knowing Howard, I'm sure there's a word of comfort in it for all of us."

The Rabbi opened the note and read, "Help, you're standing on my oxygen tube!"

---

### #652 The brothers

Benjy and Sam were mischievous brothers aged 8 and 10. They always seemed to be around when things went wrong. As their parents were unable to control them, they went to the Rabbi for help.

The Rabbi said he wanted to talk to the boys and that he would see the younger one first - alone. So they sent Benjy to see the Rabbi.

The Rabbi sat Benjy down and for the next five minutes they just sat and stared at each other across the Rabbi’s large mahogany desk. Finally, the Rabbi pointed his finger at Benjy and said, "Benjy, where is God?"

Benjy glanced around, but said nothing.

The Rabbi pointed at Benjy again and said, louder, "Where is God, Benjy?"

Again, Benjy glanced around but said nothing.

The Rabbi then leaned across the desk, put his finger on Benjy’s nose and said, "Benjy, I ask you, where is God?"

At this point, Benjy got scared, got up and ran home. He dragged Sam upstairs to his room and said, "We're in deep trouble, Sam."

Sam asked, "What do you mean we’re in deep trouble, Benjy?"

Benjy replied, "I'm telling you, Sam, we're in big trouble. God is missing and they are saying we did it."

### #653  Alphabetical order

Many years ago, during a trans-Atlantic flight, the pilot got on the intercom and said he was experiencing difficulties and that the weight of the plane would have to be reduced. He suggested the passengers throw their luggage off the plane. Everyone did.

A short time later, he got back on the intercom, "The plane is still too heavy, so some passengers will have to jump off - but we're going to do this alphabetically. Will all African-Americans, please jump off the plane."

No one stood up.

"Will all blacks, please jump off the plane."

Still no one stood up.

"Will all coloureds, please jump off the plane."

Again, no one stood up.

Then a smart, well-mannered little black boy turned to his prim and proper, well-educated, affluent mother and said, "Mama, ain't we all those things?"

And the mother answered, "No baby, we're Schvartzas today."

### #654 Tickets please

Shlomo and Issy were queuing to buy train tickets to London. Behind them were Mick and Pete. You can imagine Mick and Pete’s surprise when not only did Shlomo and Issy buy just one ticket, but also that both of them got on the train.

The train was 15 minutes into its journey when a ticket inspector came into their carriage. Mick and Pete waited for Shlomo and Issy to get caught, but before the inspector saw them, Shlomo and Issy ran into one of the toilets. When the inspector came to the occupied toilet and knocked on the door shouting, ‘ticket please’, a ticket immediately appeared under the door. The inspector clipped it and passed it back.

Mick and Pete were astounded by the trick - and mad because they had bought two tickets. They vowed to do likewise next time.

A few days later, Shlomo and Issy were in the queue to buy their ticket back home. But when they saw Mick and Pete buy just one ticket, they immediately left the queue without buying any ticket.

15 minutes into the train journey, when the ticket inspector entered their carriage, Mick and Pete ran into one of the toilets. Shlomo and Issy followed them and knocked on the toilet door. As soon as the ticket was passed underneath the door, Shlomo and Issy grabbed it and dashed into another toilet. (You can guess what then happened!).

### #655 The sermon

(My thanks to Marcos Sokiransky from Buenos Aires for the true story on which this joke is based)

One Friday night I was in the synagogue and the Rabbi was giving his usual sermon. At the end of his speech, he told the congregation, “Before we continue, I would like to inform you that our synagogue has decided to collect goods for the most needy people in our area. It’s for a good cause and we need your help. Please bring us this Sunday anything you have lying around your house that you can spare or have no great need for. For example, I’m sure that you can all think of something that you have excess of.”

Behind me I heard the voice of an old lady saying to her neighbour seated next to her, “Yes, Tsuris.”

(Tsuris: A word referring to all problems, trouble, grief, aggravation and heartache. Examples: daughter pregnant with child of an unemployed Catholic bartender, adult son loses job and moves back home. Major tsuris: daughter and baby ‘Bridget’ move back home too.)

### #656 The flight of the Rabbis

Thirteen Rabbis were on their way to Jerusalem when their flight ran into a big thunderstorm. One of the Rabbis immediately called over a stewardess. Wanting to calm her nerves, he said, "Could you please tell the pilot that everything will be all right because there are 13 very religious men aboard this plane."

A few minutes later, the stewardess returned from the cockpit.

She told the Rabbi, "Our pilot said that although he was pleased to learn that we have 13 holy men aboard this flight, he would still rather have just one good engine."

### #657 Love, hate and heaven (or mistaken identity)

David, Abe and Moishe are waiting in line to get into Heaven. When David gets to the front of the queue, the Angel Gabriel says to him, "Heaven is nearly full today and I can only admit those who have had horrible deaths. What's your story?"

"I suspected my wife was cheating on me," says David, "so I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. I knew something was wrong as soon as I entered my flat, but I couldn’t find where the other guy was hiding. However, when I went out onto my balcony, there was this man hanging onto my railings. I was furious and started kicking him but he held on so I got a hammer and battered his fingers. He couldn't take that and had to let go. He fell 20 stories but he somehow landed in some thick bushes and only stunned himself. So I ran into my kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the balcony. My aim was perfect – it landed right on top of him, killing him instantly. Unfortunately, all the raw anger got to me. I had a massive heart attack and I died on my balcony."

"That sounds quite bad to me," says the Angel Gabriel, and he lets David in.

The Angel Gabriel then turns to Abe and explains to him about Heaven being full and asks for his story.

"It's been a very unusual day for me," says Abe. "I live on the 21st floor of a Dockland’s tower and every morning I do exercises on my balcony. Unfortunately, this morning I slipped on the wet floor and fell over the edge. Luckily, I managed to grab the railing of the balcony below mine. All of a sudden, a man bursts out onto the balcony and just for a moment I thought I was saved. But he was a madman and he starts beating me. I somehow held on but when he started hammering at my hands, I had to let go. But I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, winded but OK. But my luck ran out when a fridge fell on me. Now I'm here."

Once again, Angel Gabriel agrees that sounds like a pretty horrible death and lets Abe in.

Moishe comes to the front of the line and again the whole process is repeated. Angel Gabriel explains that Heaven is full and asks for his story.

"Picture this," says Moishe, "I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator......."

### #658 The shul visitors

Rabbi Bloom of the United Orthodox Synagogue was playing golf one Sunday when he meets three members of the Federation Reform Synagogue on the course. They talk and he invites them to come to his shul. Next Shabbos they make an appearance, but because they turn up some time after service began, all the main seats are filled. Several other latecomers were already seated on folding chairs.

Rabbi Bloom calls over the Shammas. "Moishe, please get three chairs for my reform friends in the back."

Moishe is a bit deaf so he leans closer and says, "I beg your pardon, Rabbi?"

Rabbi Bloom again says, "Get three chairs for my reform friends in the back."

Moishe was puzzled but as there was a lull in the service, he goes to the front of the shul and loudly announces, "The Rabbi says, 'Give three cheers for my Reform friends in the back!'"

### #660 Will the real mother-in-law please stand up

Many years ago, a Jewish town had a shortage of single men of marriageable age and they used to bring them in from nearby towns. One day, when a suitable man arrived by train, not one but two mother-in-laws-to-be were waiting for him and each claimed him for themselves. So the Rabbi was called to sort it out.

After he heard the facts, he said to the two women, "If you still both want him, then we'll have to cut him in half and each one of you can then have half of him."

One kept quiet while the other said, "In that case, give him to the other woman."

When the Rabbi heard this, he immediately said, "OK, I agree. The other woman can have him. Anyone willing to cut him in half is obviously the real mother-in-law!"

### #661 Recognition

Moshe wants to buy a parrot and goes to his local pet shop to see what they have. The assistant shows him a parrot and explains that this one is really quite special - it can speak most languages. So Moshe decides to test this out.

"Do you speak English?" asks Moshe.

"Yes," replied the parrot.

"Hablas Espanol?" asks Moshe.

"Si," replied the parrot.

"Parlez vouz Francaise?" asks Moshe.

"Oui," replied the parrot.

"Sprechen sie Deutsch?" asks Moshe.

"Jawohl," replied the parrot.

"Falas Portugues?" asks Moshe.

"Sim," replied the parrot.

Moshe pauses for a while, then asks the parrot, "Do you speak Yiddish?"

The parrot shrugs its shoulders and says, "Nu? Vis a nose like dis, vot you tink?"

### #662 The relationship

Whenever 4-year old Miriam was asked her name, she replied, "I'm Mr Levy’s daughter."

So her mother tells her this is wrong and that she must answer, "I'm Miriam Levy."

Next shabbos, after the service, the Rabbi asks her, "Aren't you Mr Levy’s daughter, little girl?"

Miriam replies, "I thought I was, but my mother says I'm not."

### #663 Medical facts

Issy and Rabbi Samuel were sitting next to each other on the tube train one night. Issy was returning home after another wild leaving party in the City, where he worked, and Rabbi Samuel was going to the Yeshiva to study. They often saw each other on the tube train and not for the first time, Issy smelled of beer, his shirt was stained, and his face was covered in lipstick.

Issy unfolded his Jewish Chronicle and began to read. After a few minutes, he turned to the Rabbi and asked, "What causes arthritis, Rabbi?"

Rabbi Samuel replied, "It's caused by loose living, being with cheap, uninhibited women, drinking too much alcohol and contempt for your fellow man."

"Really?" replied Issy, "It says here in my paper that the well known Rabbi Jacobs has a very bad case of arthritis."

### #664 The gift

One year, Louis didn’t know what to buy his mother-in-law for her birthday, so he bought her a large plot in Bushey cemetery.

The following year, Louis bought her nothing for her birthday and his wife was quick to comment loud and long on his thoughtlessness to her mother.

"So, why didn’t you buy her something?" she snapped at him.

"Well, she hasn’t used the gift I gave her last year," he replied.

### #665 A visit to the Rabbi

Even though they were brought up strictly orthodox, Shlomo, 8 and Isaac, 10 were very naughty brothers. When anything went wrong in Golders Green, they were nearly always involved.

One day, a friend visited their parents and mentioned a Rabbi who was having great success with delinquent children. As they were finding it difficult to control their boys, they went to this Rabbi and asked whether he could help.

He said he could and asked to see the younger boy first – but he must be alone. So Shlomo went to see the Rabbi while Isaac was kept at home.

The Rabbi sat Shlomo down across a huge, solid mahogany desk and he sat down on the other side. For 5 minutes they just sat and stared at each other. Finally, the Rabbi pointed his finger at Shlomo and asked, "Where is God?" Shlomo said nothing. Again, in a louder tone, the Rabbi pointed at Shlomo and asked, "Where is God?" Again Shlomo said nothing. Then the Rabbi leaned across the desk, put his finger on Shlomo's nose and shouted, "For the third time, Shlomo, where is God?"

Shlomo panicked at this, got up and ran all the way home. He went straight up to Isaac’s room and said, "We are in big trouble, Isaac."

"What do you mean, big trouble, little brother?" said Isaac.

Shlomo replied, "God is missing... and I’m sure they think we did it."

### #666 The mitzvah

As soon as the shabbos service had ended, little Benjy walks up to Rabbi Bloom and says, "When I grow up, Rabbi, I'm going to give you lots of money."

Rabbi Bloom laughs and replies, "That's really good to know, Benjy, but why do you want to do this?"

Benjy replies, "Because my Dad says you're the poorest Rabbi we have ever had!"

---

### #667 The nibbler

Rabbi Levy was running behind with his daily schedule because he had attended a number of unforeseen events. His next port of call was Mrs. Gold. As soon as he arrived at the nursing home, the matron said, "Rabbi, Mrs. Gold has been waiting to see you all day. She was afraid you had forgotten all about her."

The Rabbi apologized, and went straight to Mrs. Gold’s room. He sat down in the chair next to her bed and after he had said a few words of encouragement to her, she began to talk about her day. Whilst he was listening, he noticed a small bowl of peanuts next to her, so he interrupted and asked her if she would mind if he took a few of the peanuts.

"No, of course not," she replied and continued talking at length about her day.

A few minutes later, Rabbi Levy interrupted her again and said, "Mrs. Gold, I'm sorry but I've eaten almost all of your peanuts."

Mrs. Gold smiled at him and said, "Don't worry about it Rabbi, I can't eat peanuts - I just like to nibble the chocolate off them."

### #669 The operation

Recovering from major heart surgery, Moishe awoke to find the curtains in his private ward drawn. When his surgeon arrived, he immediately saw the perplexed look on Moishe’s face. So he said, "Please don’t be alarmed, Moishe. There’s a large fire in the garden right outside your window and we didn't want you to wake up and think the surgery was a failure".

### #670 Forget Something?

Because their memories were getting so bad with old age, Sadie and Sam had to put things in writing to help them remember them. One night, Sam got up from watching the usual TV soap and said to Sadie, "I’m going to the kitchen for something to eat. Do you want anything while I'm there?"

Sadie said, "Yes, Sam, some ice cream, please."

Just as Sam set off she added, "And write it down."

"Don’t worry, I can remember ice cream," said Sam.

Then Sadie said, "I also want strawberries on my ice cream... Write it down."

"No need, I can remember ice cream with strawberries," he replied.

Sadie added, "But I also want whipped cream on top of the strawberries."

Sam nodded, but left the room without writing anything down.

When he returned, Sam was carrying a plate of cold roast beef with mustard.

"Now see what you've done," she said, "You’ve forgotten the toast I asked for."

### #671 Creation of Israel

On the sixth day God turned to the angel Gabriel and said, "Today I am going to create a land called Israel. It will be a land of outstanding natural beauty. It will have rolling hills and mountains full of goats and eagles, a beautiful, sparkling, clear ocean full of sea life and high cliffs overlooking white sandy beaches."

God continued, "And I shall make the land rich in oil to allow the

inhabitants to prosper. I shall call these inhabitants ‘Jews’ and they shall be known as the most friendly people on the earth."

"But," asked Gabriel, "don't you think you’re being too generous to these Jews?"

"Not really," replied God, "just wait and see the neighbours I am going to

give them."

### #672 My heroic Zeida

My Zaida was very religious. He prayed 3 times a day and laid tefillin every morning. One night, he heard a noise downstairs and having no fear for his safety went downstairs to see what it was. It was a burglar and he was putting my Zaida’s silver cutlery, wine goblets and candlesticks into a bag. This made my Zaida very angry and he shouted at him to stop. He then tried to take the bag away but when he reached for it, the burglar pulled a knife out of the bag and was just about to stab my Zaida when all of a sudden, my Zaida screamed out "nisht mit the milchidic messer" (not with the dairy knife).

### #673 Business versus pleasure

Issy owned a small deli in Hendon. One day, a tax inspector knocked on his door and questioned him about his recent tax return. Issy had reported a net profit of £50,000 for the year and he wanted to know all about it.

"It’s like this," said Issy. "I work like a maniac all year round and all of my family help me out whenever they can. My deli is closed only five times a year. That’s how I made £50,000."

"It's not your income that bothers us," said the taxman. "It's the business travel deductions of £80,000 that worries us. You entered on the tax return that you and your wife made fifteen business trips to Israel."

"Oh," said Issy, smiling. "I forgot to tell you that we also deliver."

### #674 The meeting

Hannah and Natalie hadn’t seen each other since they were at school together over 30 years ago. But it’s a small world and they meet by chance in Brent Cross shopping Centre one Sunday afternoon. Hannah tells Natalie about her children. "My son is a doctor and he's got three children of his own. My daughter is married to a lawyer and they have two fabulous girls. What about you, Natalie?"

Natalie replies, "I’m married to Moishe and sadly, we don't have any children. So we don’t have any grandchildren."

Hannah says, "If you have no children and no grandchildren, tell me, what do you do for aggravation?"

### #675 The drawing session

[My thanks to Charles Kohnfelder for the following joke]

Moshe is having a session with his psychiatrist.  Doctor Cohen draws a picture of a triangle and asks Moshe what it looks like to him.

Moshe shows some excitement and says, "It looks like a man & woman in bed."

"Hmmm," says Doctor Cohen, stroking his beard. He then draws another picture, this time of a square, and again asks Moshe what it looks like to him.

Moshe gets more excited and says again, "It looks like a man & woman in bed."

Again Doctor Cohen says "Hmmm", strokes his beard and then draws another picture, this one a circle. He asks Moshe what this looks like to him.

Moshe is agitated and replies, "It looks like a man & woman having intercourse."

Doctor Cohen says, "Young man, I think you have too much sex on your mind."

Moshe replies, "That’s unfair – it’s you who's drawing the dirty pictures."

### #676 The Aliyah

[My thanks to Hilary for the following joke]

A Gabbai approaches a guest in the synagogue and says, "I want to give you Aliyah. What’s your name?"

The man answers, "Rifka bat Jacov."

The Gabbai says, "No, I need your name."

The man says, "I told you, it’s Rifka bat Jacov."

The Gabbai asks, "How can that be your name?"

The man replies, "I've recently been in some serious financial difficulties and so everything is now in my wife's name."

### #677 Preparing for the wedding

[My thanks to Peter Scolding for the following joke]

Maurice, age 92, has just asked Sarah, age 89, to marry him and she has accepted. Mazeltov! They are both very excited and decide to go for a walk so that they can discuss the wedding arrangements. On their walk they pass a large chemist and decide to go in. Maurice asks to see the owner.

When a young man comes up to them, Maurice asks, "Are you the owner?"

"Yes I am," says the man, "how can I help?"

"We're about to get married," says Maurice. "Do you sell heart medication?"

"Of course we do," replies the owner.

"How about medicine for improving circulation?" asks Maurice.

"We stock all kinds, sir."

"What about remedies for rheumatic conditions?" asks Sarah.

"Yes, no problem, madam."

Maurice then asks, sheepishly, "Do you stock that Viagra, then?"

"Of course, sir."

Sarah then asks, "What about vitamins, sleeping pills, antidotes for Parkinson's, medicine for memory problems, arthritis and jaundice?"

"Yes, we stock a large variety of all of these. The works, madam."

Maurice then asks, "Do you sell wheelchairs and Zimmer frames?"

"Our speciality. We have many sizes and all speeds."

Maurice finally says to the owner, "OK. We'd like to set up our wedding gifts list here, please."

### #678 Length matters

[My thanks to Ronda Hegeman for the following joke]

Abe is an old Jewish guy who sells cloth. He lives next door to Smith, the biggest anti-Semite in town.

One day Smith calls on Abe and says, "Hey Jew!!!... I need a piece of orange cloth.  Its length must be from the tip of your nose to the tip of your penis, and I want it delivered tomorrow."

Abe says, "OK."

The next morning Smith is awakened at 7am by the sound of running engines.  He runs outside to see a row of lorries lined up one after the other dumping loads and loads of orange cloth in his front garden.  Soon his garden is 5 ft deep in orange cloth. Abe then presents Smith with a bill for £15,000

Smith starts yelling and screaming at Abe.  "What is this, Jew? This is not what I asked for.  I told you I needed a piece of cloth from the end of your nose to the tip of your penis.  Look at this place. What do you have to say for yourself?"

With a straight face, Abe replies, "I'm very careful when I deal with people like you. That's why I’ve got a few witnesses here with me. I may be off by a few miles, so I gave you a 5% discount; but...the tip of my penis was left in Poland after my circumcision."

### #679 Bad food

Moishe, an elderly man, was listening to a dietician addressing a large audience in London.

"Did you know," said the dietician, "that the stuff we regularly put into our stomachs is harmful enough to eventually kill most of us here today? Well it’s true. Red meat is terrible for us, soft drinks erode our stomach lining, Chinese food is loaded with Monosodium Glutamate and even vegetables can be disastrous to some of us. And most of us don’t realise the long-term harm being caused by additions to our drinking water. But bad as these are, one thing is worse than all of these put together and we have all eaten it or will eat it. Can anyone here tell me what food causes the most grief and suffering for years after eating it?"

Moishe stood up and said, "Wedding cake."

### #680 The birthday present

Shlomo was driving home one evening when he suddenly remembered that it was his daughter's birthday and he hadn't bought her a present. So he drove to Brent Cross Shopping Centre and ran all the way to the toyshop.

"How much is the latest Barbie doll?" he asked the manager.

The manager replied, "Which one? We have 'Barbie goes to the Gym' for £17.99, 'Barbie goes to the Dance' for £16.99, 'Barbie goes to the Shops' for £15.99, 'Barbie goes to the Seaside' for £18.99, and 'Barbie goes to the Barmitzvah' for £19.99. We also have 'Divorced Barbie' for £350.00".

Shlomo is confused and asked the manager, "Why does ‘Divorced Barbie’ cost £350 when all the others are less than £20?"

"It’s simple," replied the manager, "divorced Barbie comes with Ken's car, Ken's House, Ken's boat, Ken's dog, Ken's cat and Ken's furniture."

### #683 Good advice

When Jewish children were asked what advice they would give to other children, here are some of the answers they gave.

### #685 Moishe Magic

Moshe Magic (a Jewish magician, would you believe?) was playing to a packed London variety theatre. When he came to the point in his act where he needed someone to help him, he called up the biggest, strongest-looking man he could find in the audience.

When the helper came up on stage, Moshe Magic handed him a rubber mallet and said, "When I put my head on this wooden block, hit me as hard as you can. And don’t worry about hurting me - it won't effect me at all. It’s my act."

The man said, "Okay, if you say so."

So Moshe Magic put his head on the block and said, "OK, you can hit me now."

Ten years later, Moshe Magic woke up in a hospital bed from a coma and yelled, "Ta-Da!"

### #686 Helping the needy

Hette had just got back home after a trip to Brent Cross shopping center when she was shocked to find her husband Bernie lying in their bed with a beautiful young woman at his side.

Hette was speechless and ran from the room crying. Bernie went after her and caught her just as she was opening the front door to escape.

Bernie said, "Before you leave me, Hette, please let me explain. I was driving home this afternoon when I saw this woman sitting on a wall at the bottom of our road. Her clothes were in tatters and she looked so tired and sad that I just had to stop and ask whether she needed any help."

"She told me she was hungry so I brought her back home and gave her the piece of last night’s roast chicken you said you didn’t want. Her shoes were so worn out that I gave her a pair of your shoes that you don’t wear any more. She was so cold that I gave her that sweater you said was no longer in fashion that you were going to give to the charity shop. Her skirt was also worn out so I gave her a new skirt from your wardrobe – one that you said didn’t fit you anymore."

"Then just as she was about to leave the house, she asked me, 'Is there anything else that your wife doesn't use anymore?' And so, here we are!"

---

### #687 Should I marry?

Moshe was talking to his friend Issy. “Issy, I’m nearly 40 years old. Do you think I should marry?”

“By all means get married,” replied Issy. “If you get a good a wife, you'll be happy. If you don't, you’ll become a philosopher -- and that’s a good thing for any man.”

### #688 The Rolls Aviv

Rabbi Levy handed in his notice, left his synagogue and opened up a Jewish bookshop. He worked very hard for several years and then decided to buy a new car. He put on a dark suit and white shirt, which looked impressive with his long beard, and went to see John, the local car dealer.

As soon as John saw him, he said, "Have I got a car for you, Rabbi!"

Levy looked at John and said, "What do you mean?"

"I mean a Rolls Aviv," said John, "a British built car with Israeli designed computerized digital commands for the religious driver.  Come over here and let me show you. You won’t believe your eyes. It’s unique."

John opened the door of the Rolls Aviv and Levy got in.

"Notice that it has no accelerator or brake pedal," said John.

"So how do you stop and start it?" said Levy.

"Ah, that's the wonder of the Israeli computerized technology. It has a digital VMA-box that converts words into instructions the car understands. All you have to do is to speak the right words and the car will know what to do."

"I don't believe it," said Levy.

"It’s true. To begin driving the car, just say, "baruch ha’shem (thank God)."

And as John spoke those words, the car began to move.

Levy was frightened. "How do you stop it?"

"That's easy. Just say, 'shema yisroel', and the car will stop," said John and as he spoke these words, the car braked to a halt.

"So there it is. Say 'baruch ha’shem' to start and 'shema yisroel' to stop."

Levy was so impressed, he bought the car right away. He got in, said the words, 'baruch ha’shem' and soon the Rolls Aviv was heading out towards the M1 motorway. Unfortunately, Levy failed to see a sign that said,

"Warning – unfinished bridge ahead. Take next turning left."

so the car continued to move at speed towards the bridge.

"Oy Vay! I’m going to crash. How do I stop it?"

Panicking, he couldn’t remember what John told him. His mind was a blank and the car was quickly approaching the end of the unfinished bridge.

"This is the end of me," Levy thought and preparing for death, he started reciting the shema. Suddenly, the Rolls Aviv screeched to a halt with half of the car tilting over the bridge. Levy removed his trembling hand from his forehead, saw how close he had come to disaster and exclaimed with conviction, 'baruch ha’shem'".

### #689 The lottery winner

Moshe just couldn’t believe it - he had won a top prize in the lottery. He just had to tell his best friend.

Maurice congratulated Moshe and asked how he had picked his six numbers.

“I chose my age and the ages of my wife and 3 children,” replied Moshe.

“But that’s only 5 numbers,” said Maurice. ”What about the sixth number?”

“Well, it was a miracle,” replied Moshe. “Six sevens appeared to me in a dream and danced before my very eyes. Six times seven is 49 and so I chose 49.”

“Hey, wait a minute,” said Maurice, “six times seven is 42 not 49.”

“Huh? . . . All right, so you be the mathematical genius.”

---

### #690 The separation

Shlomo and Hette had been living apart for a number of weeks and decided to visit their Rabbi to see whether he could help solve their problems and save their marriage. Following some lengthy counselling with the Rabbi they made a brief attempt to reconcile their differences, but in the end they failed. They quickly decided to end their union.

In court to finalize their separation, the judge asks Shlomo, "So tell me, what has brought you to the point where you are unable to keep your marriage going?"

Shlomo replies, "In the seven weeks we've been back together, your honour, we just haven't been able to agree on one little thing."

Hette interrupts, "He means eight weeks, your honour!"

### #691 The difficult question

One day, Benjy comes home from school, goes straight to his father and asks, "What is fornication, Dad?"

And he gets the answer all Jewish fathers give - "Why don’t you ask your mother, son?"

So Benjy goes into the kitchen and asks his mother, "What is fornication, Mum? Dad said you would know."

His mother replies, "I’m busy right now, Benjy, why don’t you go and ask your Bubbe, she will tell you."

So Benjy goes upstairs to his Bubbe’s room, knocks on her door and shouts, "Please, Bubbe, what is fornication? No one here seems to know."

Bubbe says, "Come inside tatallah,"

She then takes him to her wardrobe, opens the door, takes out a beautiful full length pink beaded evening dress and says, "This, tatellah, is foranoccasion."

---

### #692 What do they do?

Jewish Women: They carry children, they carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. They smile when they want to scream, sing when they want to cry, cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. They wait by the phone for a "I got home safely" call after a friend drives home in a storm. They are childcare workers, executives, lawyers, and stay-at-home mums. They fight for what they believe in and they stand up against injustice. They walk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the right schools and to get their family the right health care. They go to the doctor with a frightened friend. They are honest, loyal and forgiving. They are smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But they still know how to use their softer side to make a point. They want to be the best for their family, their friends and themselves. Their hearts break when a friend dies. They have sorrow at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left. They drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a Jewish woman is what makes the world spin! They do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope. They give compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends and all they want back is a hug, a smile and for you to do the same to people you come in contact with.

Jewish Men: They are good at lifting heavy stuff and killing bugs.

### #693 The two Rabbis

Rabbi Bloom and Rabbi Levy always greeted each other at shul by saying, "Good Shabbos" to each other. One shabbos, Rabbi Bloom, the younger of the two, asked Rabbi Levy, "What by you is a good shabbos?"

Rabbi Levy replied, "By me, a good shabbos is when I wake up, have a good

breakfast, go to shul, the bar mitzvah boy does a good job, my sermon

goes down well, we have a kiddush, I have a whisky, go home to lunch,

have a little sleep, a little studying, and then say Havdalah. That to me is a good

shabbos. And what is a good shabbos by you?"

Rabbi Bloom replies, "By me a good shabbos is when I wake up, turn around and my wife and I make mad passionate love. Get up, shower, get dressed, have breakfast, snuggle a bit with my wife, walk to shul, do all the things you

mentioned in shul, and come home. My wife and I make mad passionate love, have lunch, go out for a walk hand in hand, come home, go to bed and make mad passionate love once more. Then I make Havdalah. And that by me is a good shabbos."

"That," says Rabbi Levy, "is not a good shabbos. That is a GREAT

shabbos."

### #694 Come up and see me sometime

Jacob had just returned to Kiev after visiting London. As soon as he got home, he wrote the following letter to a friend he had met in London just before he left.

“It was so nice to meet with you. If you are ever in Kiev, please come and visit me, I would be glad to see you again. It’s easy to find me. Go to the main street in Kiev and start walking straight from its beginning at the Station. Take the third turning on the right and continue down this road until you come to the Kiev Flats. Go through the archway and you'll find yourself in a big courtyard surrounded by apartment buildings.

Then shout out as loud as you can, "Rabbinowitz."

You'll immediately see faces looking at you from all the apartment windows in the courtyard except one! This is my window, because my name is Rosen."

### #695 Sadness at the cemetery

[My thanks to Hilary of Melbourne, Australia for the following joke]

Isaac was a very successful marketing director. Sadly, his wife Rifka dies. At the cemetery, Isaac's friends and family are appalled to see that the headstone reads: -

"Here lies Rifka, wife of Isaac Levy, MCIM, Post Graduate Diploma in Marketing and Marketing Director of Quality Marketing Services Ltd."

Isaac was standing in front of Rifka's grave reading the headstone when he suddenly burst into tears.

His brother says to him, "I'm not at all surprised that you find this distasteful. It's right that you should cry, pulling a cheap stunt like this on our Rifka's headstone."

Through his tears, Isaac sobs, "You don't understand. They left out the phone number."

### #696 It’s quiet upstairs

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following joke]

Sadie, as she did every Sunday afternoon, went with her young son Moshe to visit her best friend Rifka and her young daughter Hannah. When

they arrive, both mothers send their children upstairs so they can talk about their neighbours. The children are first given a stern warning they are not to fight. After about an hour, everything is too quiet upstairs so Sadie hollers out, “Children, you’re not fighting up there are you?”

Moshe’s voice comes back, “No mum, were not fighting, we’re schtooping.”

Sadie replies, “That’s good children, don't fight.”

### #697 The juice bar

[My thanks to Michael Berglin of Minnesota for the following joke]

Issy and his wife were taking a car trip and Issy notices that he is getting low on petrol. Up ahead was a combination fast food outlet and petrol station. So he pulls in. As he is thirsty, Issy walks up to the juice bar.

The young kid who is wiping down the counter looks up and says, “Juice?”

Issy replies, “So what if we are, don't we get no petrol?”

---

### #698 The helping hand

[My thanks to Malcolm Goodman for the following joke]

Maurice came home from the Reform synagogue one Saturday with a black eye.

“Maurice, what ever happened?” asked his wife Becky.

“Well,” said Maurice, “it was like this. During the service, we had to stand several times and on one occasion I noticed that Mrs Levy, who was sitting in front of me, had her dress stuck in the crease of her bottom, so I leaned forward and pulled it out.  But Mrs Levy didn’t like this at all - she turned around and hit me full in the face with her prayer book.”

The following week, Maurice comes back from synagogue with the other eye blackened.

“And what happened this time, Maurice?” asked Becky.

“Well,” says Maurice, “it was like this. Once again Mrs Levy had her dress trapped, but this time my friend Issy saw it. He leaned over and carefully pulled out the dress. But I know that Mrs Levy doesn't like this - so I tucked it back in again!”

### #699 The Christmas present

Father Christmas was working at Brent Cross Shopping Centre when he noticed a young lady, about twenty years old and wearing a large gold Magen Dovid pendent around her neck, walking towards him. He was surprised, therefore, when she sat on his lap. Now Santa doesn't usually take requests from adults, but as she gave him such a nice smile, he couldn’t refuse.

He said to her, "What’s your name?"

"Hannah," came the reply.

"And what does a nice Jewish woman like you want for Christmas, Hannah?"

"Actually, I want something for my mother, please," said Hannah.

"Something for your mother? Well, that's very thoughtful," smiled Santa. "What do you want me to bring her?"

Without blinking, Hannah replied, "A son-in-law."

### #700 Nothing left

When Sadie’s husband dies, she has only £25,000 to her name. After all the expenses are paid, she tells her closest friend Ruth that she has no money left.

Ruth says, "How can that be, Sadie? You told me you had £25,000 just a few days before Maurice died. How can you now be broke?"

Sadie replies, "Well to tell you the truth, Maurice and I were not paid up members of any synagogue. So the funeral cost me £5,000, the hospital bill came to £3,000 and of course, I had to make the obligatory donation to the synagogue, another £3,000. All the rest went on the memorial stone."

Ruth does some silent calculating and then says, "£14,000 for the memorial stone? My God, Sadie, how big was it, what was it made of?"

Extending her left hand, Sadie replies, "Three and a half carats."

### #701 The funeral ceremony

Moishe meets Arnold at their social club and asks how Abe’s funeral went the other day.

"It went OK, Moishe," replied Arnold, "but at the end of the Rabbi’s eulogy, I had to try and stop myself from laughing aloud."

"Why was that?" asks Moishe.

"Well," says Arnold, "throughout his marriage to Miriam, she was always telling me what a mean man he was. He never had a steady job and the money he brought home to her wasn't enough for food and clothing, let alone holidays. Yet he drank heavily and often stayed out all night gambling. Altogether, a good husband he was not. But at the funeral, the Rabbi spoke of how wonderful the deceased was - so considerate, so beloved, so thoughtful to others. Then, when the Rabbi had finished, I heard Miriam say to one of her children, "Do me a favour, David, go see whether it’s your father in the coffin."

---

### #702 Home truth

Shlomo was talking to his friend Moishe, who had just moved to a house near him in Hampstead Garden Suburb.

"Why don’t you join our local synagogue, Moishe?" asked Shlomo.

"Why should I?" replied Moishe?"

"So that your children will realise they're Jewish," said Shlomo.

"But they already realise they're Jewish," said Moishe. "They have heartburn."

### #703 Good choice

Sadie was making some pancakes as a treat for her two young sons, Simon and Nicky. But the boys began to argue as to who should get the first pancake she made.

"Shame on you boys," said Sadie. "If the wise King Solomon were here today, he would say, ‘let my brother have the first pancake’."

Nicky looked at Simon and said, "OK, Simon, you be King Solomon today."

### #705 The steal

As soon as Issy got home from work one evening, his wife Becky came up to him and said, "Issy, our au pair has stolen two of our towels."

"Oh, really," said Issy, not looking very interested, "that wasn't a nice thing to do."

"You're damn right it wasn't," said Becky, "they were the best towels we had, the two we got from the Hilton Eilat while we were on holiday last Passover."

### #706 The cure?

Moishe goes to see his doctor and says, "You must help me, doctor. Sadie isn't interested in sex anymore. Do you have something I can give her?"

"I’m not really allowed to prescribe..." the doctor starts, but is interrupted.

"Doctor, can we talk off the record please? In all the years we've known each other, have you ever seen me like this? I’m desperate. I can't concentrate, my business is failing and I’m going to pieces. I beg of you – please help me."

The doctor takes a bottle of pills from his cabinet and says, "I really shouldn’t do this. These pills are still experimental and the results so far indicate that they're very powerful. So please don't give Sadie any more than one at a time. I suggest you put it in her coffee. Do you understand, Moishe?

"Yes. Thanks doctor."

Later that evening, after dinner, when Sadie goes into the kitchen to fetch the dessert, Moishe drops one pill into Sadie’s coffee, hesitates, and then drops in a second pill. But Moishe couldn’t forget the doctor saying they were powerful. What should he do? In a flash of inspiration, he also drops a pill into his coffee.

Sadie returns with the lochshen pudding, which they both enjoy with their coffee. Five minutes after they finish, Sadie takes a deep breath, sighs and starts to shake. A strange look comes over her and in a sexy tone of voice she says, "Oy vay, Moishe, do I need a man right now."

Moishe’s hands are now trembling as he replies, "Me too."

### #707 The interview

Yossi was the manager of an up-market menswear store in New Bond Street and was interviewing Abe for the recently advertised salesman role. Yossi looks at Abe’s CV and notices that Abe has never worked in retail before.

So Yossi says, "What a chutzpah, if you don’t mind me saying. For someone with no retail experience, you are certainly asking for a high salary."

"Well I suppose I am," Abe replies, "but you must realise that the work is so much harder when you don't know what you're doing."

### #708 A visit to the doctor

Benny is nearly 80 years old and goes to his doctor for his yearly medical checkup. His wife Becky comes along with him.

As soon as they enter the doctor’s office, the doctor says to Benny, "I need a urine sample and a stool sample."

Becky shouts back, "He wants your underwear."

### #709 Holiday booking

Shlomo and Moshe were talking one day about holidays. Shlomo says, "I think I am just about ready to book my winter holidays again, but I’m going to do it differently this time. In the past, I have always taken your advice about where to go. Three years ago you said to go to Eilat. I went to Eilat and my wife Ruth got pregnant. Then two years ago, you told me to go to Bermuda and Ruth got pregnant again. Last year you suggested the Canary Isles and as you know, Ruth got pregnant yet again."

Moishe asks, "So what are you going to do different this year, Shlomo?"

"This year," replies Shlomo, "I'm taking Ruth with me."

### #710 Seder song number 1 – There’s no Seder like our Seder

(sung to the tune of "There's no Business like Show business")

There's no seder like our seder,

There's no seder I know.

Everything about it is halachic

Nothing that the Torah won't allow.

Listen how we read the whole Haggadah

It's all in Hebrew

'Cause we know how.

There's no Seder like our seder,

We tell a tale that is swell.

Moses took the people out into the heat

They baked the matzah

While on their feet

Now isn't that a story

That just can't be beat?

Let's go on with the show!

### #711 Seder song number 2 - Elijah

And suddenly that name

Elijah!

He had his cup of wine,

But could not stay to dine

This year--

Elijah!

For your message all Jews are waiting:

That the time's come for peace

and not hating--

Elijah--

Next year we'll be waiting.

Elijah!

### #713 Seder song number 4 – These are a few of our Passover Things

(sung to the tune of "These are a few of my favourite things")

Cleaning and cooking and so many dishes

Out with the hametz, no pasta, no knishes

Fish that's gefillted, horseradish that stings

These are a few of our Passover things.

### #714 Modern Haggadah selections

We were slaves to our employers, working seven days a week with no benefits, and then the unions were organized, and decreed a five-day working week and many days holiday during the year. Now if the unions had not gotten their act together, then we, and our sons, and even our grandsons, would still have to receive lowly wages. But our daughters and granddaughters still await their salvation.

[My thanks to Diane Minkoff for the following joke]

"I know it," said Moishe, "but I've got a problem. My sex drive is too high. Have you got anything you can give me for it?"

The doctor's mouth dropped open. "Your what?" he gasped.

"My sex drive," repeated Moishe, "is too high and I'd like you to lower it."

"Lower it?" exclaimed the doctor, still unable to believe what his 75 year old patient was saying. "Just what do you consider high?"

"These days it seems like it's all in my head, doctor," replies Moishe, "and I'd like to have you lower it a couple of feet if you can."

### #717 The train ride

[My thanks to Sylvia Suchall for the following joke]

Issy had never been on a train in his life. One day, he decided that as it was a lovely sunny day, he would try a train ride. Off he went with his yarmulke on his head, a shtick of vusht under one arm and a blackbread & some herrings in a jar in the other. He sits down in a plush compartment and gets settled down to fress. Suddenly, a porter pops his head in and says. “Sir, you will have to leave this compartment. It’s reserved for the Archbishop of Canterbury.”

Issy replies “Vell, how do you know I’m not de Archbishop of Canterbury?”

### #719 Dying wishes

[My thanks to Michael Berglin for the following joke]

Rivkah is on her death bed and the Rabbi was there with her.

“Rivkah,“ says the Rabbi, “do you have any last wishes?”

“Yes,” replied Rivkah, “I want to be cremated.”

“What!” says the Rabbi, “you know that is forbidden.  But, I suppose...”

“Next, says Rivkah, “I want my ashes spread out on the roof of Brent Cross Shopping Centre.”

“Rivkah,” says the Rabbi, “I must protest - why would you want to do that?”

“Well,” says Rivkah, “that way my daughters would come and visit me once a week.”

### #722 Letter to my son

My dear darling Moshe and that-person-you-married-against-my-wishes,

Happy New Year and well over the fast to you. Please don’t worry about me – I’m well, considering I am having trouble breathing and eating. All I want is for you to have a nice holiday thousands of miles away from your mother.

Please find attached to this letter my last £20. I am just hoping that you will spend it on my grandchildren, poor babies - God knows their mother never seems to buy them anything nice. Maybe you’ll buy some food, as they look so thin in the photos you sent me.

Thank you Moshe for the flowers you sent me on my birthday. To save you money, I have put them in the freezer in the hope that they will last until my funeral. And please don’t think of sending me any more money. I realise you will need it yourself for your next who-knows-where-in-the-world expensive holiday.

I lost my walking stick last week beating off muggers, but don’t worry - when I finish writing this letter, I shall crawl back to bed. I am even beginning to get used to the cold since the landlord turned off the heating. The frost helps to numb the constant pain.

Please give my love to my darling grandchildren and give my regards to ‘her’.

Love from your devoted mother.

“Well, my son can afford to,” said the owner, “he has a very rich father.”

### #724 A really old joke

There was a time when Pharaoh was repeatedly breaking his promise to release the children of Israel from bondage in Egypt.

So Aaron said to his wife, “You know Sarah, this Pharaoh is really turning out to be a first class momzer.”

“Aaron,” said Sarah, “You mustn’t say such things. We are all one family. Don’t forget we are all children of God, even Pharaoh.”

“I cannot deny that this is true,” replied Aaron, “but this Pharaoh, he must come from your side of the family!”

### #725 The secret

Sadie had worked as an accounts clerk for the Prague candlesticks company for nearly 30 years when she died. Everyone remembered how she would arrive at her desk every morning at exactly 8.30 am. She would put on her glasses, unlock her desk, and peer closely into the centre drawer. Then she would re-lock her desk and get on with her work. She did this every working day and no one, not even the senior accountant, knew what was in her centre drawer. Now she was dead, her work colleagues could find out her secret.

So they unlocked her desk and opened the centre drawer. Inside they found a small piece of paper with these words written on it, “THE SIDE TOWARDS THE DOOR IS THE DEBIT SIDE.”

The Jewish Chronicle had heard that Benjy was coming up to his 108th birthday so they sent one of their reporters to interview him.

"How do you account for your longevity?" asked the reporter.

"You could say that I am a health nut," Benjy answered. "I have never smoked or drunk alcohol, I am always in bed by ten o'clock, I’ve been going to Israeli dance classes since I was a teenager and I've always walked three miles a day, even in rain or snow."

"But," said the reporter, "my uncle Shlomo followed exactly the same routine and he died when he was 70. So how come it didn't work for him?"

"All I can say," replied Benjy, "is that he didn't keep it up long enough."

### #728 He had a hat (alternative version)

Sadie walked into a print lab to have a photo of her deceased husband Moshe copied and retouched.

She said to the technician, "I have always hated the hat that my husband Moshe is wearing in the photo. Could you please retouch the hat out?"

### #729 Let the boss go first

A junior manager, a senior manager and Moshe their boss, are on their way to a meeting. On their journey through a park, they come across an oil lamp sticking out of the ground under a bush. They pick it up, rub it, and out pops a genie.

The genie says, "Thank you very much. I normally grant three wishes but as there are three of you, I can only allow one wish each."

Without waiting for the others, the eager senior manager shouted, "I want the first wish. I want to be in the Bahamas, on a fast boat with loads of money and have no worries for the rest of my life."

POW and he was gone.

The junior manager couldn’t keep quiet and shouted, "I want to be in Florida with beautiful girls all around me, and plenty of good food and champagne."

KERPOW and he was gone too.

### #752 The wedding present

Abe was well known for his meanness and his ‘eye for a bargain’. One day he was looking for a cheap wedding present for his niece, so he went into a gift shop in Golders Green. As he was walking around, he noticed what was previously an expensive glass crystal vase lying in the corner. It was in 3 pieces. After some haggling with the owner, Abe bought the broken vase for £1. He then filled in the congratulations card, wrote out his niece’s name and address and gave the owner a further £10 so that the broken vase could be gift wrapped and posted. Abe then left the shop feeling quite pleased with himself. He expected his niece to think the vase had broken in the mail.

A few days later, he rang his niece to see if the present had arrived.

“Yes, Uncle Abe, but unfortunately, it was in 3 pieces when it was delivered.”

“What terrible luck.” said Abe, “The Royal mail is getting worse all the time.”

“It’s a shame,” she replied. “It was so beautifully wrapped. Each piece separately.”

“I want you to paint me in the nude,” she said, “Do you have any objections?”

“Not for £7,000 I don’t. But I would have to keep my socks on. I must have somewhere to put my brushes.”

[My thanks to Ronda Hegeman for the following joke]

Old Avrahom was a poor tailor whose shop was next door to an upmarket French restaurant. Every day at lunch time, Avrahom would go out the back of his shop and eat his black bread and herring while smelling the wonderful odours coming from the restaurant's kitchen. But one day, Avrahom was surprised to receive an invoice from the restaurant for ‘enjoyment of food’. So he went to the restaurant to point out that he had not bought anything from them.

The manager said, "You’re enjoying our food, so you should pay us for it."

Avrahom refused to pay and the restaurant sued him.

At the hearing, the judge asked the restaurant to present their side of the case. The manager said, "Every day, this man comes and sits outside our kitchen and smells our food while eating his. It is clear that we are providing added value to his poor food and we deserve to be recompensed for it."

The judge turns to Avrahom and said, "What do you have to say to that?"

Avrahom didn’t say anything but stuck his hand in his pocket and rattled the few coins he had inside.

The judge asked him, "What is the meaning of that?"

Avrahom replied, "I’m paying for the smell of his food with the sound of my money."

### #758 Religious conference

[My thanks to Luke Petschauer for the following joke]

At a conference on religion a priest, a minister and a rabbi were all asked the same question, "What would you like people to say about you after you die?"

The priest said, "I hope that people will say that I was able to rise above the scandals that are plaguing the Catholic Church at this time. I hope that people would say that I was able to shepherd my flock through this crisis and help them to understand the absolute love that God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit have for all of them as Catholics."

The minister then said, "When I die I hope that people will say that I saved many souls by bringing them to Christ. I hope that I will be remembered as a caring, thoughtful man who always spread the Word, the love of Christ and a faith everlasting in God. I hope that my preaching and converting will be carried on in my memory and to the glory of Christ."

Finally, the rabbi was asked, "Rabbi, what do you hope people will say about you after you have died?"

Without pausing, the rabbi answered, "Look. He's breathing."

Benny says, "But I'm really upset, rabbi."

"So maybe you should go to see the Reform rabbi over the road," says the rabbi.

As Benny walks away dejectedly, he turns to the rabbi and says, "What a shame. I was willing to donate £1,000 for such a service."

At which point the rabbi shouts, "Come back, come back."

Benny turns round and says, "I thought you couldn't help me."

"Ah," says the rabbi, "but you didn't tell me your dog was Orthodox."

“No I don’t,” Lionel replied, “but I'll admit I was wrong. What did I do?”

### #763 The kind man

Benjamin returned home early from an overseas business trip and quietly let himself into his house. He crept upstairs – and found his wife in bed with a strange man. The stranger was sprawled naked on top of the sheets and was looking very pleased with himself.

"Rifka, how could you do this to me?" Benjamin shouted.

"Wait, darling," said Rifka. "You know that soft blue leather jacket I’ve been wearing recently? Well this is the kind man who gave it to me. And that pearl and diamond gold necklace you always like me wearing? Well this is the generous man who gave it to me. And do you remember when you couldn't afford to buy me my own car and I came home with an Audi? Well this is the caring man who gave it to me."

Benjamin thought about this for a few moments, looked again at the scene before him and then said, "For goodness sake, Rifka, don’t you know it's freezing in here. Cover him up at once. We don’t want him to catch a cold."

### #765 Lost soul

Lionel was wandering around Marks & Spencer one day looking quite worried. Then he notices a beautiful lady doing her shopping. As she was on her own, he goes up to her and says, "Excuse me, but I could do with your help. I've lost my wife Sadie here in the shop. Could you please talk nicely to me for a few minutes?"

"Why would that help you?" she asks him.

"Because every time I talk to a beautiful woman, Sadie appears out of nowhere."

### #766 From you know who

Moshe goes into his local post office to buy some stamps. As he walks up to the counter, he sees a middle-aged man methodically sticking stamps onto a pile of pink envelopes. He was also placing ‘I Love You’ heart-shaped stickers onto the envelopes. When he had finished, the man took out a bottle of French perfume and sprayed all the envelopes with it.

Moshe had to find out why, so he goes up to the man and asks.

The man replies, "I'm sending out 100 scented Valentine cards, each one signed, 'From you know who'."

"Why so many?" Moshe asks.

"Because I'm a divorce lawyer and business is not so good."

### #767 The sleepers

Daniel and Naomi, who had never before met, are travelling on the same overnight sleeper train from London to Edinburgh. The train was packed and they end up in the same sleeping carriage. Daniel has the top bunk and Naomi has the bottom bunk. After some initial embarrassment, they both get to sleep.

At 1am in the morning, Daniel leans over and says to Naomi, "I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm really very cold. Could you please pass me another blanket?"

Naomi looks up at him and says, sexily, "I've got a much better idea – why don’t we pretend we're married."

"Why not?" says Daniel, "that’s a marvellous idea."

"Good," Naomi replies. "Go get your own blanket, then."

### #768 The recordings

Rabbi Bloom was getting quite a reputation for his sermons. His synagogue was always packed because his congregation didn’t want to miss a single one of his words.  One Sabbath, one member had to go to another synagogue to attend a nephew's bar mitzvah. Because he didn't want to miss the sermon, he asked one of his non-Jewish friends to go in his place and tape the Rabbi’s sermon. In that way, he could listen to it when he got back.

When other members of the congregation saw what was going on, they too decided to ask their non-Jewish friends to go in their places to record the sermon. They could then do other things, such as play golf or go to football.

Within a short time, there were 100 gentiles sitting in the synagogue recording the Rabbi’s sermon.

The Rabbi got wise to this. So the following Sabbath, he, too, asked a non-Jewish friend to attend on his behalf. His friend brought a tape recorder and played the Rabbi’s pre-recorded sermon to the 100 non-Jews in the congregation who then recorded the sermon on their own machines.

This was believed to be the first incidence in history of "artificial insermonation."

### #769 The pick up

One afternoon, Maurice, a wealthy solicitor, was driving his Rolls Royce when he passed two poor looking men by the side of the road eating grass. Maurice quickly stopped his car, backed up to the men, wound down his window and asked, "What on earth are you two doing?"

"I’m starving, I have nowhere to live and I don't have any money to buy food," said one of them.

"You can come with me to my house, then," said Maurice.

"But I’ve got a wife and three kids just up the road."

"So we’ll bring them along, too," replied Maurice.

"And what about my friend?"

Maurice turned to the other man and said, "You can come with us, too."

"But, sir," said the friend, "I’ve got a wife and six children just up the road."

"OK. So we’ll bring them as well," said Maurice. "Now get in my car, both of you."

Soon, everyone had been picked up.

They had been travelling for only a few minutes when one of the men said to Maurice, "You’re very kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."

Maurice replied, "I’m happy to be able to do it. And you'll love my place - the grass is almost a foot tall."

### #770 The bargain

Max was in coats but unfortunately business was very bad.

One day his partner Benjy said to him, “What are we going to do with these fifty coats? They’re last year’s style and even though we’ve knocked them down to £10 each, we still can’t sell any.”

Max replied, “Use your head, Benjy. Price them at £20 and send all our best clients five coats each. But here’s the plan. Put in an invoice for £80 for only four coats. If I know them, my clients will think we’ve made a mistake. They’ll jump at a bargain and pay the £80.”

“What a terrific idea,” said Benjy. “I’ll send them out today.”

Two week’s later, Benjy says to Max, “What a stupid idea it was. Every one of our clients returned the parcel and the invoice, but only sent back four coats.”

### #771 Business is business

Hetty and Hannah hadn’t seen each other for some time when they bumped into each other in Brent Cross shopping centre.

"A dentist! Why the change in career?"

### #774 The trip to Rome

Moshe and Abe were partners in a very successful clothing factory. It had been in operation for many years and there wasn’t much they didn’t know about the shmatta business. One day, Moshe decided to take a trip to Rome.

As Abe had many catholic friends, he surprised Moshe by getting him an audience with none other than the Pope.

On Moshe’s first day back at work after his Rome trip, Abe asked him, "So, Moshe, what kind of a man is the Pope?"

Moshe replied, "I would say he's a 44 regular."

### #775 I understood!

[My thanks to BMS for the following joke]

Old Yitzhak is standing in a Moscow street looking through the window of a huge grocery shop. He mutters, "So they have no more beef... And no more lamb... And they don’t even have any pork... or chicken... or sausage. In fact they have no meat at all. Nor do they have any milk or cheese or eggs or flour or …..."

Suddenly, a man standing next to Yitzhak hisses in his ear, "Shut up, you stupid Yid. Stop spreading anti-Soviet propaganda or I'll hit your stupid head with the butt of my gun. Have you understood me?"

"Yes, I understood, I understood you, comrade," replies Yitzhak and he walks away as fast as he can.

When Yitzhak arrives back at his house, he says to his wife, "Leah, I really understood. They don't have any bullets either!"

“Yes... I'd like ... a cup of tea ... with two teaspoons ... of sugar.”

“Why?” they ask him.

“I’ve had a long life... and all of that time... when I drank tea in my own house... I used one spoon of sugar... When I had tea... in someone else's house... I put three spoons of sugar in my cup... But really... really... all my life... I loved tea... with two spoonfuls of sugar.”

“But why are you wearing a tie?” asks Jacob.

“Well,” replies Shlomo, “what if someone drops in to visit me?”

### #778 Business is business

[My thanks to Uriah Y for the following joke]

Moshe was fed up with the life in Mokum (Amsterdam's Jewish name) so he decided to resettle in a new place. He moved to northern Brabant (an area without Jews and the heart of the Roman Catholic part of Holland).  He started a small bazaar and sold everything and at an extremely low price. As he wanted to become one of the hevre, he went to the local church every Sunday just to hear the sermons but without getting geshmad/converted.

The local shop owners soon got fed up with Moshe and decided to ask the priest for his assistance. The priest listened to their story and asked them to return the next day.

When they returned, the priest told them of his solution. They were then asked to contribute 100 guilders to the roof building fund of the church.

Next Sunday, Moshe as usual was sitting in the front of the church near the pulpit to listen to the sermon. Suddenly in the middle of the sermon the priest looked straight at Moshe and said, “I want all Jews to leave this church.”

Moshe wasn’t sure he heard it correctly so he stayed seated. The priest repeated, “I want all Jews to leave this church.”

Moshe stood up, went over to the cross, took Jesus off and said, “Let's go. We’re not wanted here!”

### #779 Alternative Jewish Jokes

[My thanks to Deborah E for the following joke]

All we ever hear are "Jewish" jokes and sometimes they grow tiresome. So here are some Gentile jokes.

### #780 The new gorilla

[My thanks to Roberto H for the following joke]

Daniel is a Jewish actor who’s so down and out that he's ready to accept any acting part that comes along. One day he sees an advert in the Jewish Chronicle, ACTOR NEEDED TO PLAY A GORILLA.

I could do that," says Daniel and he arranges an interview.

The employer turns out to be the local zoo who have spent so much renovating the grounds and improving the habitat that they can’t afford the gorilla they need. Until they can get more funding, they’ve decided to use an actor in a gorilla suit. Needing the money, Daniel takes the job.

At first, he feels not only dishonest by fooling the customers but also undignified in the ape suit, stared at by crowds who watch his every move. But after a few days on the job, he begins to be amused by all the attention and starts to put on a show for the spectators - hanging upside-down from the branches, swinging on vines, climbing up cage walls and roaring whilst beating his chest. Soon, Daniel is drawing a sizable crowd.

One day, when Daniel is swinging on a vine to show off to some children, his hand slips and he goes flying over the wall into the lion's den.  Terrified, Daniel backs up as far as he can from the approaching lion, covers his eyes with his paws and starts to pray aloud, "Shma Yisrael Ado-nai Elokeinu Ado-nai Echad." (Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one).

The lion opens its powerful jaws and roars, "Baruch shem k'vod malchuto l'olam va'ed." (Blessed is the name of His glorious kingship forever and ever).

"Shut up you two schmucks," mutters a panda from a third cage. "You'll get us all fired."

### #781 The brave Rabbi

One early winter morning, Rabbi Bloom was walking beside the canal when he saw a dog in the water trying hard to stay afloat. It looked so sad and exhausted that Rabbi Bloom jumped in and after a struggle managed to bring it out alive.

A passer by saw this and said, “That was very brave of you. Are you a vet?”

Rabbi Bloom replied, “Of course I’m a vet? I’m a freezing cold as vell.”

### #782 The painless invention

The time had arrived for Moshe to take his Leah to hospital to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor told them that he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother’s labour pain to the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour.

The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than Moshe had ever experienced before. But as the labour progressed, Moshe felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. Moshe was still feeling fine. The doctor checked his blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%.

Moshe continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out Leah considerably, Moshe encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. Leah delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

Leah and Moshe were ecstatic. When they got home, they found their milkman dead at their front door.

### #783 Follow me

Arnold and Abe are walking their dogs past the synagogue one Saturday morning.

Arnold says, "Lets go in. I hear they have really nice chopped liver at the kiddish on Shabbat."

Abe says, "they will never let us in with the dogs."

"Just follow my lead," says Arnold and goes into the synagogue.

As he thought, the shammas tells him, "No dogs are allowed."

Arnold says, "But it's my seeing-eye dog."

The shammas says, "Sorry, I didn’t know. Ok, you can go in."

Abe follows.

Again the shammas says, "no dogs are allowed."

Abe says, "But it's my seeing-eye dog."

The shammas says, "This is your seeing eye dog? A chihuahua!"

Abe looks startled and says, "is that what they gave me?"

### #784 The thoughtful son

Sidney passes by a pet shop in Oxford Street and notices a parrot in the window selling for £1,000. He goes inside and asks why it costs so much. The salesman tells him the parrot speaks five languages.

"Five languages!" exclaims Sidney. "Does it speak Yiddish?"

"Sure it does," says the salesman.

As his mother lives by herself in Golders Green, Sidney decides to send her the parrot as a present - it'll keep her company. So he pays the £1,000 and arranges for the shop to deliver the parrot to his mother.

The next day he phones his mother. "Mum, Did you like the parrot I bought you?"

"Mmm, it was delicious!" she says.

"What do you mean delicious?"

"I made soup out of it, it came out great!"

"But mum, the parrot wasn’t for eating. It spoke five languages including Yiddish."

"So why didn't it say anything?"

### #785 The old man and the priest

Abe, an elderly gentleman, was sitting on a bench in Brent Cross Shopping Centre when a priest sat down next to him. Because he had never had a chance to talk to a priest before, Abe asked, "Excuse me, but vhy do you hev your shoyt collar on beckvurds?"

The priest replied, "I wear this collar because I am a Father."

Abe said, "I am also a fadder but I vare mine collar frontvays. So nu, vhy do you vare your collar differently?"

The priest replied, "Because I’m the Father for many."

"I am also the fadder for many," said Abe. "I have five sons, three daughters and many grandchildren, kinahora, but I still vare my collar like normal. So vhy do you vare it yore vay?"

The priest was getting a bit fed up with this questioning and replied, "Because I am the Father for over two hundred people."

Abe was taken aback and was silent for a while. Then, as he got up to leave, Abe said to the priest, "Mister, maybe you should vare your pents beckvurds instead."

### #786 The threesome

A priest, a minister, and a Rabbi are playing a round of golf but are having to play very slowly because there is a foursome ahead of them. At long last they complete their round and each of them tramps back to the clubhouse to complain to the golf pro.

The pro tells the priest, "They're blind - that’s why they were slow."

The priest replies, "That's very inspiring. I'm so impressed that I’m going to collect some money for them by organizing a blind golfer's tournament."

The pro then tells the minister, "They're blind - that’s why they were slow."

The minister replies, "That's so uplifting that I'm going to use them as my theme for next Sunday's sermon."

The pro then tells the Rabbi, "They're blind - that’s why they were slow."

The Rabbi replies, "If that’s so, then why can't they play in the dark?"

The younger son replied, "Am I my brother's kippah?"

### #790 The tailor

Isaac was out shopping in Golders Green when he sees a sign in a window saying, ‘JACOB’S CUSTOM MADE CLOTHING’. He’s not sure whether to go in – it looks an expensive shop. But Jacob, the owner, sees him hesitating and quickly invites him in.

"What are you looking for?"

"A suit."

"Good," said Jacob, "you’ve come to the right place. When we make a suit here, you’ll be surprised at how we go about it. First, digital cameras take pictures of your every muscle and we download the pictures to a special computer to build up your image. Then we cultivate sheep in Australia to get the very best cloth. For the silk lining, we contact Japan for their silkworms, and we ask Japanese deep-sea divers to get the pearl buttons.

"B-b-bbut," said Isaac, "I need the suit for a Barmitzvah."

"When?"

"Tomorrow."

"…You’ll have it."

### #791 The business

One day Maurice shows Louis around the slaughterhouse. "Look son," says Maurice, proudly pointing to one of the many pieces of advanced machinery on show, "You see that machine? You put one whole ox into the front end and out the back come some little weenies. Great piece of British ingenuity, isn’t it?"

He then looks to Louis for some kind of positive reaction but Louis just stares and says, "Uh, duh. . . do you have a machine where you put in a weenie and out comes an ox?"

Surprised, Maurice replies, "There is a machine like that - your mother."

### #795 Yet another check-up

[My thanks to Diane Minkoff for the following joke]

Hyman recently had a full medical check up. When he returned 3 weeks later after the exhaustive lab tests were complete, his doctor said he was doing "fairly well" for his age.

Hyman was obviously a little concerned about that comment and so asked his doctor "Do you think I'll live to be 80, doctor?"

He replied, "Well, do you smoke or drink beer?"

"Oh no", Hyman replied, "I've never done either."

Then the doctor asked, "Do you eat grilled steaks or barbequed ribs?

Hyman replied, "No, I've heard that red meat is very unhealthy."

"Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf?" asked the doctor.

"No I don't," Hyman replied.

Then the doctor asked, "Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or mess with women?"

"No," said Hyman, "I've done none of those things."

The doctor looked at Hyman and said, "Then why do you want to live to be 80?"

### #798 Lasting impression

Moshe was one of those men who had very few girlfriends. When, on rare occasions, he was invited to parties, not only did people forget his name but also they did not take what he said seriously. Even when he tried to be funny, nobody laughed at his jokes! So naturally he was very depressed. When his counsellor suggested he should do something positive to impress his friends and neighbours, Moshe decided to rent a camel.

He put on his khaki shorts and pith helmet and got on the camel. He then rode up and down Edgware looking very proud. Everywhere he and the camel went, there was a buzz of surprise. Passers by stared, pointed, shouted and talked about him. Moshe repeated this activity every day for a week. But then someone stole his camel and Moshe had to go to the police to report the theft.

“I have come to report the theft of a camel,” said Moshe.

“A camel?” said the sergeant, “OK, let me have some details. How tall was it?”

“Maybe 6 or 7 feet tall,” replied Moshe.

“What colour was it?”

“Light brown/grey.”

“Was it male or female?” asked the sergeant.

“Male,” replied Moshe.

“Are you sure?” asked the sergeant.

“Definitely,” replied Moshe, “every time I rode it, I could hear passers by yelling, ‘look at that shmuck on the camel.’”

Avrahom turns to Sadie and asks, "What?"

### #801 The shake-up

‘The Kosher Leather Company Ltd’ felt it was time for a shake-up and advertises for a new Managing Director. Morris gets the job.

Morris is determined to rid the company of all slackers. On his first tour of the factory, he sees a young man leaning against a wall. The area is full of production workers and he thinks this is a good time to let them all know he means business.

Morris walks up to the man and asks, "How much money do you make a week then?"

The young man looks at Morris and replies, "I make £240 a week. Why do you want to know?"

Morris then hands the man £240 in twenty pound notes and shouts, "Here's a week's pay. Get out of here and don't let me see you here again."

Feeling pretty good about his first dismissal, Morris looks around and asks, "Does anyone want to tell me what that idiot did here?"

With a smile on his face, one of the workers replied, "He’s a pizza delivery guy from Domino's."

Bernard replies, "I’m sure that my wife Sarah is poisoning me."

The Rabbi is surprised by this and says to Bernard, "I'm sure you can’t be right."

But Bernard pleads, "I'm telling you, Rabbi, I'm certain Sarah’s poisoning me and I don’t know what to do."

The Rabbi shrugs his shoulders and says, "OK, if I can talk to Sarah, I might be able to find out what’s happening. I can then let you know what I’ve discovered."

Bernard says, "Thank you Rabbi. What would I have done without you?"

A week later, the Rabbi calls Bernard and says, "Well, I contacted Sarah – in fact I spoke to her on the phone for over three hours. Do you want my advice now?"

Bernard replies, "Yes, please, Rabbi."

"I think you should take the poison!"

### #803 The Jewish dog

Hymie walks into his synagogue with a dog. The shammas immediately comes up to him and says, "This is a House of Worship, Hymie, you know you can't bring a dog in here."

"What do you mean I can’t?" says Hymie, "Look at him, he’s a Jewish dog."

The shammas then notices that the dog has a tallis bag round its neck.

Hyme then says to the dog, "Benjamin, daven for me."

The dog stands on his back legs and says, "Woof woof, woof," then opens the tallis bag, takes out a kippa and puts it on his head, exactly in between its ears.

"Woof, woof," says the dog who then pulls out a tallis and puts it round his neck.

"Woof, woof, woof," says the dog who then takes out a siddur and starts to pray, rocking from side to side.

"That's brilliant," says the shammas, "totally incredible. You must get him on TV and the movies and you could make millions.”

"You speak to him then," says Hymie, "he wants to be a doctor."

### #806 The synagogue course

“What time does the course start, Rabbi?”

The Rabbi replied, “Oh... fivish, sixish....”

### #807 The decorator

One day, as soon as she woke up, Hannah decided that she was sick and tired of all her husband Arnold’s blonde jokes and how he thought that all blondes were stupid. To show Arnold how wrong he was and to prove to him that blondes really were smart, Hannah decided to decorate two rooms while he was at work.

When Arnold returned home that evening, he immediately smelled the distinctive aroma of wet paint. He went into the dining room and there he found Hannah lying on the floor in a pool of sweat. He couldn’t help but notice that she was wearing her fur coat on top of her ski jacket.

He went over to her and asked, “Are you OK, darling?”

She replied, “Yes, of course I am.”

“So what on earth are you doing dressed like that?” he said.

“Darling,” she said, “I wanted to prove to you that not all blonde women are dumb and I wanted to do it by painting some rooms in our house.”

“But why are you wearing your fur coat over your ski jacket?” he asked.

“I was reading the directions on the paint can, “she replied, “and it said....

FOR BEST RESULTS, PUT ON TWO COATS.”

### #811 I’m better now

Benjamin was talking to his friend Isaac. “Do you know, Isaac, that I married my Hetty for her looks, but not the ones she's been giving me lately! Ever since we got married, she has tried to change me. She got me to exercise daily, improve my diet, and to stop smoking. She taught me how to dress well and enjoy the fine arts. She introduced me to gourmet cooking, classical music and she taught me how to invest in the stock market. But between you and me, Isaac, I am now thinking of divorcing her. I'm already such a better person that she just isn't good enough for me any more.

"Yes," replies Sidney.

"Well I'm at the shopping centre," she says, "and I’ve found a beautiful leather coat. It's £450. Can I buy it?"

"OK, " says Sidney, "go ahead and buy it if you like it that much."

"Thanks," she replies. "I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and had a close look at the 2003 models. I saw one that I really liked."

"How much was it?" asks Sidney.

"£37,000," she replied.

"For that price," says Sidney, "I want it with all the options."

"Great," she says. "Just one more thing. That house we wanted last year is back on the market. They're only asking £750,000 for it now."

Sidney says, "Well then, go ahead and buy it, but don’t offer more than £720,000."

"OK," she says, "I'll see you later. I love you."

"Bye, I love you too." says Sidney and then hangs up.

The other men in the locker room who heard all of this conversation are looking at Sidney in astonishment.

Then Sidney shouts out aloud, "Does anyone know who this mobile phone belongs to?"

I look like someone who has just died. What on earth is wrong with me?”

Doctor Myers gives Sadie a quick examination, looks her in the eyes and says to her, “Well, I can say one thing I’ve discovered, there’s nothing wrong with your eyesight!”

### #820 The rescue attempt

Jacob is a very religious man. One day, a nearby river floods its banks and rushes into town, forcing Jacob to climb onto his garage roof. Soon, a man in a boat comes along and tells Jacob to get in.

Jacob says, "That’s very kind of you, but no thanks. God will take care of me."

So, the boat leaves.

The water rises and Jacob has to climb onto the roof of his house. Another man in a boat comes along and tells Jacob to get in.

Jacob replies, "That’s very kind of you but no thanks. God will take care of me."

The boat leaves.

The water rises further and soon Jacob is clinging to his chimney. Then a helicopter arrives and lowers a ladder. The helicopter pilot tells Jacob to climb up the ladder.

Jacob replies, "That’s very kind of you but no thanks. God will take care of me."

The pilot says, "Are you really sure?"

Jacob says, "Yes, I'm sure that God will take care of me."

Finally, the water rises too high and Jacob drowns. He goes up to Heaven and is met by God.

God replies, "Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter. What else did you want me to do?"

### #822 Sir Benjy takes a holiday

Benjy had done very well in business. He was a multi-millionaire and had been knighted by the Queen for his endeavours. One day, after completing yet another very successful business deal, he decided on the spur-of-the-moment to take his wife Sadie to Israel. He asked his secretary Carol to make the arrangements.

Carol rang the Tel Aviv Dan hotel and asked to speak to the manager.

“I am happy to inform you that Sir Benjy and his wife have chosen to stay at the Dan next week. But as they are very wealthy and require total privacy, they would need to book the entire hotel for their stay. Money is not a problem. Can you set this up?”

The manager didn’t hesitate. “Yes, I can move all guests to a sister hotel.”

Carol then asked, “Is there a private beach?”

“Yes.”

“What colour is the sand?” asked Carol.

“Silver,” came the reply.

“Well that will be a problem as Sir Benjy always insists on golden sand.”

“OK. I can get round it,” said the manager. “There’s a quarry nearby and I will arrange for golden sand to be laid on the beach.”

“And finally,” said Carol, “Sir Benjy prefers a blue sky without a cloud in it. Is the weather going to be perfect next week?”

“No problem,” said the manager, “I will get the Israeli Air Force to seed the clouds and so disperse them.”

The following week, there was Benjy and Sadie sunbathing on the wide expanse of the private beach of the Dan hotel. Benjy looked all around him and said, “Sadie, just look how beautiful everything is. We have privacy, there is not a sound coming from the hotel, the sand is beautifully clean and golden and the sky is so blue without a cloud in sight.  Sadie, with all of this, who needs money?”

“Me, in Accounts?” said Shlomo, “why I can’t even add 2 figures together.”

“All right then, what about IT?”

“What do I know about IT?” said Shlomo, “for years I thought PC stood for police constable.”

A Rabbi dies and is waiting in line to enter heaven. In front of him is a guy dressed in a loud shirt, leather jacket, jeans and sunglasses.

Gabriel addresses this guy, "I need to know who you are so that I can determine whether or not to admit you to the Kingdom of Heaven?"

Now it's the Rabbi’s turn. He stands upright and says, "I am Benjamin Himmelfarb and I had been Rabbi of Neasden for forty years."

Gabriel looks at his list and says to the Rabbi, "OK. Take this cotton robe and wooden staff and enter the Kingdom of Heaven."

"Hold on a minute," says Rabbi Himmelfarb, "that man before me was a taxi driver – why did he get a silken robe and golden staff?"

"Up here, we only work by results," says Gabriel. "While you preached, people slept – but while he drove, people prayed."

### #829 Ten holiday differences explained

1. Christmas is one day. It’s the same day every year, December 25. Jews love Christmas as it’s another paid day off work. We go to the cinema, eat at a Chinese restaurant and go Israeli dancing.

No one is ever sure - until that is, a Christian friend asks when Chanukah starts, forcing us to consult a calendar. We all have the same calendar, provided free with the Jewish Chronicle newspaper.

### #834 The hearing test

Sam was convinced that his wife Betty was getting deaf. She refused to go to an audiologist, so he asked his doctor what could be done.

"Why don’t you test Betty without her knowledge. Start at the door of the room. Tell Betty something in a normal tone of voice. If she doesn't respond, keep moving nearer, still using a normal tone of voice. That should tell you just how deaf Betty is."

"Thank you doctor."

Soon after, Sam saw his chance. He noticed Betty doing the dishes.

He said, "I love you darling."

No response.

He moved a few steps into the room and repeated, "I love you darling."

Still no response.

He moved closer, until he could almost touch her and said, "I love you darling."

With this, Betty turned around and said, "For the third time, I love you too."

### #835 The cruise liner

[My thanks to Hilary Ash for the following joke]

To avoid a catastrophe during a raging storm, the captain of the Kosher Yenta, the largest and most expensive cruise ship ever launched, decided to dock at a small port on a Caribbean island. But it was too far down to the dock below for the ship’s standard gangplank to reach, so passengers who wanted to leave the ship were asked to use a makeshift narrow piece of wood as a passageway down to the dock.

All of a sudden Sadie, aged 70, appeared at the top of the plank. The captain just stood there motionless, wondering whether she would make it down safely as there was no room for anyone to assist her. But to his great relief, Sadie edged along very slowly and eventually made it down to the dock. However, as soon as she got down, Sadie looked back up to the top of the plank and shouted, "It's OK mummy, you can come down now."

But when Yitzhak went to Moishe’s, he discovered that the shop had changed ownership and was now called Kelly’s Dry Cleaners. He asked the new owner, Sean, if he was keeping to the previous price list. Sean assured him that he was. Three days later, Yitzhak picked up his tallis and was given a bill for £12.

He was naturally angry and said to Sean, "I thought you said you met Moishe's prices?"

"I do," said Sean, "£4 for the prayer shawl and £8 to get all the knots out of the fringes!"

One night, Nathan overhears his son Benny saying his prayers. "God bless mummy and daddy and grandma. Goodbye, grandpa."

Nathan thinks this a bit strange. The next day, the grandfather dies.

Moshe quickly realizes that nothing is going to happen that night.

The next day, Moshe takes Sadie to John Lewis department store. He escorts her into Ladies Fashions and makes her try on three expensive outfits. He then tells her, "Why don’t we take all three of them?"

He then makes her choose matching shoes for each outfit at £200 a pair.  Then they go into Jewellery and he helps her choose some diamond earrings.  Sadie is so excited. She thinks Moshe has flipped out, but she doesn’t care. So she also chooses a lovely alligator bag.

Moshe says, "but you don't even like alligators! OK, if you like it, then let's get it."

Sadie is jumping up and down with excitement. She can’t believe what is going on. She says, "I’m ready, Moshe, lets go and pay for all this stuff."

But Moshe says," No, darling, we're not going to buy all this stuff."

Sadie’s face drops.

"No darling, I just want you to hold all of this for a while."

Often, when he called up a student for translation and explanation, without realizing it, he chose the same student day after day. But out of respect, the students wouldn't point this out to him.

Hymie had already been called up on three consecutive days when the Rabbi once again said "Hymie Himmelfarb, come up here and translate and explain."

Hymie replied, "Himmelfarb is absent today, Rabbi."

"OK," said the Rabbi, "why don’t you come up here and translate and explain instead."

### #857 The Queen’s English

[My thanks to Jean Reed for the following joke]

Abe ran a thriving business and was very wealthy. Many of his customers were gentiles and he was therefore proud of his success. But he was worried about his teenage son, Issy, the heir to his business. Issy often used Yiddish words and phrases, some of them vulgar, in front of customers and greatly upset them. For weeks Abe struggled with his problem. He was a widower and knew of no classy woman he felt could help. At last, the answer came to him. It was the perfect solution.

Abe went to see Father Brown, the local Catholic priest and a highly educated cleric whose command of English was flawless. As the church was having financial problems, Abe offered Father Brown £25,000 if the priest would agree to take Issy under his wing for a week and teach the boy to speak English the way he did. So, protesting loudly every step of the way, Issy went to board with the eloquent priest.

A day passed, then two, but Abe heard nothing.  Finally, on the third day, he couldn’t stand the suspense and he called the church. Father Brown answered the phone himself. Hoping for a miracle, but far from convinced, Abe asked how Issy was getting on.

"Oy," replied the priest, "let me tell you, the first few days with Issy were hell. He called me 'meshuggeh,' he said my cassock was an ugly 'shmatta', and he never stopped complaining about my 'kvetching.'"

Father Brown sighed audibly. "Nu, but don't despair, Mr Goldberg. I haven't given up. And after all, won't any improvement be better than 'bupkes'?"

"So how come I don't see you in shul except on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur?" says Rabbi Landau.

Shlomo says, "Issy, people are telling me that you don’t go to shul any more. Can it be that you no longer believe in God?"

Issy looks uncomfortable and quickly changes the subject.

The next afternoon, they meet again on the bench. "You must tell me, Issy," asks Shlomo, "don’t you believe in our God anymore?"

"OK Shlomo, here is a straight answer to your straight question," replies Issy. "No, I don’t think I do."

"Oy veh, so why didn’t you tell me that yesterday?" asks Shlomo.

Issy, looking very shocked, replies, "God forbid! I should tell you that on shabbes?"

### #871 One for the women

When Sarah sees an advert in the Jewish Chronicle,

REBECCA AND CO LTD, HIGH QUALITY DECORATORS AND GARDENERS

she contacts Rebecca for a quote to repaint the interior of her house.

Rebecca arrives and Sarah walks her through her home explaining what colours she wants for each room.

In the first room, Sarah says, "I would like this room painted in cream."

Rebecca writes it down, walks to the window, opens it and yells out, "Green side up." She closes the window and follows Sarah to the second room.

Sarah is confused, but continues, "I would like an off blue colour for this room."

Again, Rebecca writes it down, opens the window and yells out, " Green side up."

This baffles Sarah, but she is hesitant to say anything.

In the third room, Sarah says, "I would like this room painted a rose colour.

And once more, Rebecca opens the window and yells, " Green side up."

Sarah musters up courage and asks, "Why do you keep shouting 'Green side up' out my window every time I tell you the colour I would like the room?"

Rebecca replies, "Because I have a team of Jewish men laying new turf across the road."

### #874 Mixed up

Hyman is 25 and leads the most over-examined life you can imagine. Each day, he spends his time thinking about those he met that day, worrying about everything said to him, wondering about every look, gesture and expression made, and hoping he came across OK. Even when he goes to bed, he has to write at least two pages in his diary about his conclusions and how he will improve his actions the following day to make people like him more.

One day, Hyman goes to Max, one of his few friends, in a very agitated state.  “What’s wrong?” asks Max.

“Well,” replied Hyman, “my father and I never had much of a relationship whilst I was growing up. He’s always ignored me and he’s never encouraged me to succeed. I’ve been trying to get him to talk to me for some time now, but without success. Then last night, out of the blue, he rings me and invites me out to dinner. I was gob smacked. I tried to work out - why now, why dinner, why ….”

“But did you go?” said Max.

“Yes, but during dinner, I said the wrong thing. It was just a slip of the tongue really and I didn’t mean it the way it sounded.”

“Well, so what did you say?” asked Max.

Hyman replies, “I meant to say, ‘please pass the salt’, but it came out as, ‘you miserable old sod, you’ve ruined my life’.”

### #875 The bar mitzvah safari

Moshe was a bragger and loved to out-do his friends whenever he could and now it was coming up to the time of his son Isaac’s bar mitzvah. He gave it a lot of thought and then, after studying many brochures and maps, he hit upon a perfect, unique way to celebrate – a safari.

So Moshe went ahead with the detailed arrangements. He started off by hiring a special flight to Africa to accommodate all the invited family and friends. Then he chose a guide and his bearers. He phoned the guide long distance and told him what he wanted.

“I want my entourage to be able to hear jungle chants; I want to be able to shoot some wild animals, on film of course; I need a clearing to be found where my Rabbi can hold the service; and I want my son to be able to recite his prayers in Hebrew whilst standing on the body of an anaesthetised lion.”

“OK,” said the guide, “no problem.”

The guests were ecstatic when they received details of the weekend and all accepted their invite. Come the day of departure, they were all flown to Africa. On arrival, the guide and bearers were waiting for them, together with 30 elephants. Off they went with the guide leading the way and directing the elephants along the narrow trails through the rain forest.  But then, just 5hours into the journey, the column of elephants came to a sudden halt and the guide shouted, “There will now be a delay of 2 hours.”

Moshe was angry at this. “Why the delay?” he asked his guide.

“There’s nothing I can do,” said the guide, “there’s another two bar mitzvah safaris ahead of us.”

“Look at it this way Sidney,” replies Issy, as he removes one of his shoes. “Just look at this shoe. The leather seems soft and gentle, it looks great on my foot and its shape is very modern.  Don’t you agree?”

“Well it wouldn’t have surprised me,” says Sadie.

“Please let’s not argue,” says Shlomo.

“OK,” says Sadie, “but I want you to promise me something. How many cars have you ordered to go to the cemetery?”

“Four,” replies Shlomo.

“Does that include the hearse?” asks Sadie.

“Yes,” replies Shlomo, “but this is not the time to talk about it.”

“Shlomo, it’s my funeral, remember,” says Sadie. “Four cars are too many. If people want to come, let them find their own way there. Cancel one of the cars.”

“OK,” says Shlomo.

“And I want you to promise me something else,” says Sadie.

“Anything darling,” says Shlomo.

“I want you and my mother to travel together in the same car,” says Sadie.

“But darling,” says Shlomo, “you know we’ve not spoken to one another for at least ten years.”

“I know,” says Sadie, “but I don’t care. It’s what I want. Promise me you’ll do it.”

“Well, OK,” replies Shlomo, “I’ll do it, but let me tell you now, it will ruin the day for me.”

### #882 Silence is golden

Simon is a lovely 5 year old who gives his parents Maurice and Hannah much naches. Their only worry is the fact that he hasn’t spoken a word since he was born. But he appears happy and bright and he always does what he is told, so they live in hope.

One day, at breakfast, Hannah realises that they have run out of corn flakes, so she gives Simon a bowl of grapefruit segments instead. As soon as Simon puts the first spoonful into his mouth, he spits it out and shouts, “Yuck, what rubbish. It’s not nice to start the day with such bitter tasting food.”

“Simon, bubeleh, you spoke,” cries Hannah, “you’ve just said your very first words.”

“Mazeltov, son,” says Maurice.”

Hannah and Maurice dance around the room in joy. When they calm down a bit, Maurice says to Simon, “Why has it taken you so long to speak? You’ve got such a lovely clear voice and you’re already quite articulate.”

“Well,” answers Simon, “until this morning, when you gave me this grapefruit, the food I’ve been getting has always been excellent.”

She stays where she is and a bus goes across the red light at speed, just where she would have been had she crossed.

Freda is shaking at her second narrow escape and says aloud, “Who are you? Why are you helping me?”

“I’m your guardian angel,” came the reply, “and I’m just doing my job looking after you. Is there any other question you would like to ask me?”

“Yes,” replied Freda, “Where were you on my wedding day?”

### #886 Couch potatoes

I came across this exercise for those of us who need to build arm and shoulder muscles and thought I would share it with you. Doing it twice a week gives good results. The only equipment you will need are some potato sacks.

IMPORTANT: Please read all of the instructions right to the end before starting.

INSTRUCTIONS

Stand on a carpet and ensure you have plenty of room on each side of you. Hold a 5lb potato sack in each hand and extend your arms sideways, straight out from your sides. Hold this position for as long as you can, then relax. You'll find that you can hold this position for just a bit longer as each day goes by.

Do this for 2 weeks then move up to 10lb potato sacks and repeat the exercise. Repeat this with 50lb potato sacks and then, finally, with 100lb potato sacks.

When you have reached this level you can move onto stage 2 - start putting a couple of potatoes in each of the sacks, but be careful not to overdo it.

### #890 How did you do that?

Moishe the farmer had made out a Will that stipulated how his prize cows would be shared out to his 3 sons on his death. He decided that half the cows should go to his eldest son, one third to his second eldest son and one ninth to his youngest son. He though this was fair.

Some years later he died and his sons knew that there were 17 cows. But they just couldn’t divide them according to their father’s wishes. So they had to call in the learned Rabbi.

After much thought, the Rabbi went away and returned with one of his own cows, making 18 cows. Then the Rabbi gave the oldest son 9 cows, the second son got 6 cows and the youngest 2 cows. There was still one cow left over, so the Rabbi took his cow back home with him.

[My thanks to Hilary for the following joke]

Issy and Shlomo have been running a Jewish goods shop in Kilburn, London for over 40 years but the neighbourhood was not what it was and the Jewish community was moving out.

One day, Shlomo says, "Issy, our customers are moving out. Ve haff to move to where they are going - to Golders Green or Hendon, if ve vant to survive."

"Ve can't do this," replies Issy, "dis neighbourhood iz our life. Ve've been here for foity-tree years. However, instead of moving, ve should tink about sellink Katolik articles as vell as Jewish vuns."

"Vut? Katolik tings?" says Shlomo, "Dat’s a meshuggeneh idea. Ve Jews can’t sell anytink Katolik."

But in the following week they only manage to sell one mezuzah and a Barmitzvah tallit and by Friday Shlomo comes round to Issy’s way of thinking - they will have to stock some Catholic articles.  "OK Issy," he says, "You vin. Call de Katolik supplier in Cricklevood right now."   So Issy rings them.

Benny was fed up with being bossed around by his wife Leah so he went to see a psychiatrist.

Benny started to read the book on the train and by the time he got home, he had finished the book.

Benny strode manfully into the house, walked over to Leah, pointed his finger at her and said, "From now onwards you must get it into your head that I and not you make all the decisions in this house. Tonight, I want you to prepare me my favourite meal and I expect a special mouth-watering dessert afterward. Then, after dinner, you're going to run me a hot bath so I can relax. And when I step out of the bath, guess who's going to dress me and comb my hair?"

"Abrahamson, the funeral director, that’s who." replied Leah.

"You are reading my sign wrong," replies Fink. "It actually says, ‘What d'ya think? - My name is Fink? - And I sell clothes for nothink?’"

The salesgirl puts the £5 device around Benny's neck and tells him, "All you do is put this stud in your ear and run this length of wire down to your pocket."

"Nu, so does it work?" asks Benny.

"With respect, sir, for £5, it doesn't work," she replies, "but when people see it on you, they'll talk louder."

[My thanks to Ronda Hegeman for the following joke]

Abe was a poor tailor whose shop was next door a 2star Michelin restaurant. Every day for lunch, Abe would eat his black bread and herring in the small garden at the back of his shop. He would always smell the wonderful odours emanating from the next door restaurant's kitchen.

One day, the restaurant sent Abe an invoice. Abe went to see the manager to ask why.

The manager replied, "You’re enjoying my food, so you should pay for it."

Abe refused to pay and the restaurant sued him. At the hearing, the judge asked the restaurant to present their side of the story.

They said, "Every day, this man comes and sits near our kitchen and visibly smells our food whilst eating his. We are obviously adding value to his cheap food and we deserve to be recompensed for it."

The judge then asked Abe, "And what do you have to say about that?"

Abe said nothing but stuck his hand in his pocket and rattled around the coins he had inside.

The judge asked him, "What’s the meaning of that?"

Abe replied, "I am paying for the smell of his food with the sound of my money."

### #918 Shame on you

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following joke]

It’s 3am in the morning in Golders Green and Maurice and Golda are woken up by a loud banging on their front door. Maurice gets up and opens the door to a drunken stranger standing in the pouring rain.

"Can I have a push?" says the drunk.

"No you can’t," says Maurice, "it’s three o’clock in the morning. Please go away, you’ll wake the children."

Maurice shuts the door and goes back to bed.

"Who was that?" asks Golda.

"Just some drunk, dear, asking for a push," Maurice replies.

"So did you help him?" Golda asks.

"No I didn’t. It’s 3am and it’s pouring with rain," replies Maurice.

Golda says, "Shame on you, Maurice. Have you already forgotten when our car broke down about six months ago in Bournemouth and those two men helped us? I think you should help the man outside."

So Maurice reluctantly does as he is told. He gets dressed, goes out into the pouring rain and calls out, "Hello, are you still there?"

"Yes," comes back the answer.

"Do you still need a push?" Maurice shouts.

"Yes, please!" comes the reply from the dark.

"So where are you?" asks Maurice.

"Over here on the swing," replies the drunk.

### #919 Door lock

Issy drives his friend Hyman to the shops in Golders Green. As they get out of the car, Issy locks the doors in such a hurry that he forgets to remove the ignition key first.

"Oy vay," says Issy.

"Why don't we get a coat hanger to open the door," says Hyman.

"No, I don’t think that’ll work," replies Issy, "because passers-by will think we're breaking into the car."

"OK," suggests Hyman. We can use a penknife to cut the rubber seal around the driver’s door, then I can stick in a finger and pull out the key."

"No, absolutely not." replies Issy. "Passers-by will think we're stupid for not using a coat hanger,."

"OK," says Hyman, "you’d better think of something else and quick. It's starting to rain and your sun roof’s still open."

### #920 Thanks for nothing

One morning, Shlomo and Sadie decided to go out for breakfast. The waitress at The Almond Tree told them that the special that morning was two eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, hash browns and toast for £3.99.

"That sounds good," said Sadie, "but I don't want the eggs."

"OK," said the waitress, but I will then have to charge you £4.50."

"Why," asked Shlomo, "it doesn’t make sense.

"Because you will then in effect be ordering a la carte," the waitress replied.

"Do you mean I'll have to pay for not taking the eggs?" Sadie asked.

"Yes, " replied the waitress.

"OK then, I'll take the special," says Sadie.

"How do you want your eggs done?" asked the waitress.

"Raw and in the shell," Sadie replied.

At the end of the meal, Sadie took the two eggs home.

### #921 What’s the time, than?

Yitzhak had just moved into a new flat in Hendon and was out celebrating with his friend Benny. At 2am, he invited Benny back to his flat where they continued to celebrate.

Then Benny said, "Before I go, why not show me around?"

So Yitzhak proudly showed Benny his flat and all the high tech it contained. Then he took Benny into his bedroom where his friend couldn’t help but notice a very large brass gong and hammer on the chest of drawers.

"Is that a dinner gong?" asked Benny.

"It's not really a gong, Benny, it’s more like a talking clock," Yitzhak replied.

"A talking clock? Are you serious?" said Benny.

"Of course," replied Yitzhak.

"So how does it work?" said Benny.

"Watch this," replied Yitzhak, as he picked up the hammer and gave the gong an ear shattering pounding. They stood looking at each other for a moment when suddenly, someone in the flat next door screamed, "Stop that, you inconsiderate oaf. It's quarter to three in the morning."

### #922 All change

Mogadishu Yogi is visiting north London. During one of his walks, in full costume and beard, he passes a small snack bar called “Benjy’s Hot Dogs” and as he wants to try everything, he goes into the shop and says, "Make me one with everything."

Benjy goes to work and soon puts together a loaded hot dog. He hands it to the spiritual master who pays him with a £10 note, which Benjy quickly puts into his pocket.

"So," asks Mogadishu Yogi, "where's my change?"

Benjy replies, "Change must come from within."

### #923 The new companions

And Adam said, "Oh Lord, you do not visit me anymore in the garden. I am lonely here and it’s getting hard for me to remember how much you love me."

And God said, "OK, I will create you a companion who will be a reflection of my love for you and you will then know that I love you at all times. Regardless of how childish, selfish and unlovable you are, your companion will always accept and love you."

And God created a new animal for Adam and God was pleased. And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and wagged his tail.

And Adam said, "Oh Lord, I can’t think of a name for this new animal. All the good names in the animal kingdom have already been assigned."

And God said, "OK, because I created this animal, his name will be a reflection of mine and you will call him DOG."

And Dog lived with Adam and was a good companion and loved him. And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content and wagged his tail.

Later, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came to the Lord and said, "Oh Lord, Adam now struts around like a peacock and believes he is worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one has taught Adam humility."

And the Lord said, "OK, I will create another companion for Adam who will see him as he is. And this companion will remind him of his limitations and he will soon know that he is not worthy of adoration."

And God created CAT. And Cat would not obey Adam. When Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility. And God was pleased. And Adam was greatly improved. And Cat did not care one way or the other.

### #926 The examination

### #927  Religious test

Moshe, Peter and Ali were discussing who was the most religious.

"I was riding my camel in the middle of the desert," said Ali. Suddenly a fierce sandstorm appeared from nowhere. I truly thought my end had come as I lay next to my camel while we were being buried deeper and deeper under the sand. But I did not lose faith in the Almighty. I prayed and prayed and suddenly for 100 yards all around me the storm had stopped. Since that day, I am a devout believer in God."

"One day while fishing," said Peter, "I was in my little boat in the middle of the ocean. Suddenly a fierce storm appeared from nowhere. I truly thought my end had come as my boat was tossed around by the rough waves. But I did not lose my faith in Jesus. I prayed and prayed and suddenly for 300 yards all around me the storm had stopped. Since that day I’m a devout Christian and now teach young children about Him."

"One Saturday, I was walking down the road to my synagogue in Hendon," explained Moshe. "I was in my most expensive designer outfit. Suddenly I saw a leather bag drop to the ground in front of me. It appeared out of nowhere. I put my hand inside and found that it was full of money. I truly thought my end had come as we are not allowed to handle money on the Sabbath. But I did not lose my faith in my God. I prayed and prayed and suddenly for 500 yards all around me it was Sunday."

### #928 The good cook

Little Yossi and his family were having dinner at his bubbe's house. When everyone was seated, the food was served. As soon as little Yossi got his plate, he started eating from it right away.

"Yossi, please wait until we say our prayer," said his father.

"I don't have to," Yossi replied.

"Of course you have to," said his mother. "Don’t we always say a prayer before eating at our house?"

"Yes, but that's our house," Yossi explained. "This is bubbe's house and she knows how to cook."

### #929 School lunch

It was lunchtime at the Jewish nursery school and all the children were lined up by the teachers. Then, as usual, they were led into the canteen.

At the other end he noticed was a large pile of kosher chocolate chip cookies.

Moshe then whispered to his friend Sarah, "We can take all the cookies we want. God is watching the apples."

### #930 White hair

One morning, as little Hannah was sitting at the kitchen sink watching her mother wash and dry the breakfast plates, she noticed that her mother had several strands of white hair mixed in with her dark hair.

Hannah looked at her mother and said, "Why have you got some white hairs, mummy?"

Her mother replied, "Well darling, every time a daughter does something bad to make her mother cry or unhappy, one of her mother’s hairs turns white."

Hannah thought about this information for a few moments then said, "Mummy, so how come all of grandma's hairs are white?"

Rebecca paused and then said, "But no one knows what God looks like. Leah."

### #933 50th Anniversary

Moshe and Sadie lived in a retirement home in Hendon and were celebrating their 50th anniversary. Although David, Henry and Alan, their 3 sons, had successful careers, they had been visiting their parents less and less over recent times. Nevertheless, the sons agreed to visit their parents at their home for a special Sunday dinner. As usual, they all arrived late and almost immediately their excuses began.

"Happy anniversary mum and dad," spurted David, "I'm sorry I'm late but I had an emergency at the hospital. You know how it is. So I didn’t even have time to stop to get you both a present."

"Don’t worry," said Moshe, "the main thing is, we're together, aren’t we?"

Henry then came over.  "Hi dad, you're looking great. And wow, mum, don’t you look good also, you're looking just like a model. I just got in from Zurich where I closed the big deal I’d been working on for the last 6 months. So I came here straight from Heathrow and I’m sorry but I had no time to buy you both a gift. Next time, eh?"

"It's nothing," said Moshe, " the main thing is we're all together"

Then Alan came in and said, "Hi mum and dad. My firm is sending me to Paris for an important conference, so I’ll have to leave as soon as we’ve finished dinner. I’ve been so busy packing that I didn't have time to buy you anything."

Moshe sighed and replied, "I don't care as long as I have my 3 sons together."

Halfway through the meal, Moshe, in a reflective mood, said, "Now might be a good time to tell you all something that has been on your mother’s and my mind for years. Your mother and I, well, we came to England during the war. We had no money and were desperate and in our struggle to survive, I'm sorry to tell you that we never got around to getting married. We knew we loved each other and after a few years, it didn't seem so important, so…"

The 3 sons gasped, "Dad, do you mean.. do you mean.. we're bastards?"

"Yes,” replied Moshe, “that’s exactly what I do mean and cheap ones, too"

### #934 Home efficiency

Hyman was an efficiency expert and at the end of one of his lectures, he concluded with a note of caution. "Please don't try these techniques at home."

"Why not?" asked Benny, who was in the audience.

"I watched my wife's routine at breakfast for years," Hyman explained. "She made lots of trips between the refrigerator, oven, table and cupboards, often carrying a single item at a time. One day I told her, 'Darling, why don't you try carrying several things at once?'"

"Did it save time?" Benny asked.

"Actually, yes," replied Hyman. "It used to take her 20 minutes to make breakfast. Now I do it in seven."

### #935 The special cookies

[My thanks to my son Paul for the following joke]

As 80year old Benny lay dying in his bedroom, he suddenly smells the aroma of freshly cooked chocolate chip cookies wafting up the stairs. They are his favourite. So he gathers his remaining strength, lifts himself from his bed and leaning against the wall, slowly makes his way out of the bedroom. Then, with great effort, he makes his way down the stairs, gripping the rail with both hands. Finally, breathing hard, he leans against the kitchen doorframe and stares in.

"I’m already in heaven," he thinks, as there, spread out in front of him, are hundreds of his favourite chocolate chip cookies.

"Am I really in heaven," has asks himself, "or is it an act of devotion from mine darling Rebecca to ensure that I exit from this world a happy man?"

Then with one final effort, Benny propels himself towards the cookies, but ends up on his knees near the table. His aged hand trembles as it makes its way to the cookie nearest the table edge, his mind already beginning to think about the wondrous taste that he will soon experience.

All of a sudden, Rebecca smacks his hand with her wooden spoon.

"Please don't touch them," she says, "they're for the Shiva."

### #936 Too clever by half

Little 5year old Benjy was practicing spelling on his fridge using a set of magnetic letters. Freda, his mother, had watched him put together words such as ‘mum’, ‘dad’, ‘dog’, ‘cat’ and ‘car’ and was very proud of her clever son.

But then Benjy shouted out, "Look what I spelled, mummy."

Freda looked at the fridge and saw that he had put up the three magnetic letters, ‘G’ ‘O’ ‘D’.

"Why, that's wonderful, Benjy," she said, "why don’t you leave them on the fridge until daddy comes home?"

"OK, mummy," he said.

But just as Freda was thinking that the Jewish school he went to was starting to have an impact, Benjy’s little voice called out, "Mummy, how do you spell zilla?"

“No, I’m not,” replies the man.

A few minutes later, Rivkah asks him, “Please, are you sure you’re not Jewish?”

The man replies, “No, I’ve told you I’m not,” and continues to read his paper.

A few minutes later, “Excuse me, are you absolutely sure you’re not Jewish?”

At that, the man gets quite frustrated and replies, “All right, yes, if you must know. I am Jewish. Now will you leave me alone?”

Rivkah looks at him and says, “Funny, you don’t look Jewish.”

Three hours later, he still hadn’t returned and Leah was getting very worried. So she rang the Red Cross.

After four hours, a search party, with guides, dogs and army mountaineers, went out looking for Nathan.

As they climbed the slopes, they began calling out, “Mr Levy, Mr Levy, it’s the Red Cross. Where are you Mr Levy?”

When they got to the top of the glacier, they tried one more time, “Mr Levy, where are you? It’s the Red Cross.”

And then they heard a faint voice say, “It’s OK. I’ve given already.”

### #950 Well, I never

Yitzhak and Fay are travelling by car to Scotland. It is now quite late in the evening and after many hours on the road they are too tired to continue. So they decide to find somewhere to sleep for six hours and then get back on the road. They find a nice hotel and book a room.

Later, when they check out, the receptionist hands them a bill for £250. Yitzhak is angry because the charge is so high. He tells the receptionist that the rooms aren't worth anywhere near £250 and asks to speak the Manager.

The Manager listens to Yitzhak and explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a conference centre that were available for Yitzhak and Fay to use.

"But we didn't use them," Yitzhak complains.

"Well, they are here and you could have," explains the Manager.

The Manager then explains they could have taken in the variety show for which the hotel is famous. "The best entertainers in the UK perform here," he says.

"But we didn't go to any of those shows," complains Yitzhak again.

"Well, we have them and you could have," the Manager replies.

Yitzhak gives up, writes out a cheque and gives it to the Manager.

"But sir," the Manager says, "this cheque is only made out for £75."

"That's right," says Yitzhak. "I charged you £175 for sleeping with my wife Fay."

"But I didn't," exclaims the Manager.

"Well," Yitzhak replies, "she was here and you could have."

### #951 Who has enemies?

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following joke]

One shabbas morning, Rabbi Landau is giving a sermon on ‘the mitzvah of forgiving your enemies’. He talks at length on the subject for nearly 15 minutes and then asks his congregation, “Please raise your hand if you are willing to forgive your enemies.“

About 50% raise their hand.

This upsets Rabbi Landau so he decides to lecture for another ten minutes. He then repeats his question.

This time about 80% raise their hand.

But the Rabbi is still not satisfied, lectures a bit longer and repeats his question.

This time everybody raises their hand, except an old lady at the back of the shul.

Rabbi Landau asks, “Mrs Levy, aren't you willing to forgive your enemies?”

“I don't have any enemies,” she replies.

“That's very unusual Mrs Levy. How old are you?”

“I'm 98, Rabbi.”

“Please, Mrs Levy, come to the front and tell us how you have lived to 98 and don’t have an enemy in the world.”

Mrs Levy hobbles down the aisle, faces the congregation and says, with a smile, “I outlived the momzers, that’s how.”

### #953 The soldiers

[My thanks to Charles Kohnfelder for the following joke]

Private Benny and Private Harry are leading a donkey down a muddy road near their barracks when the animal suddenly just drops dead.  An officer sees this happen and while Benny and Harry are standing there wondering what they should do, the officer goes up to them.  He quickly sizes up the situation and instructs them to get some shovels from the camp and bury the poor animal.

Later, while they were digging the hole, Benny says, "Wow, is this one big mule."

Harry says, "It’s not a mule, Benny, it’s a donkey."

As they continue to argue, "donkey," "mule," "donkey," "mule," another officer, this time a Rabbi, stops to ask them what they are arguing about. They tell him of their disagreement.

The Rabbi looks at the animal and says, "It’s neither a donkey or a mule.  According to the bible, it is obviously an ass.  Now get back to work."

As they continue to dig, another officer arrives on the scene and asks them, "What are you men digging, a fox hole?"

"No Sir," replies Benny, "not according to the bible."

They continue to rock silently for a few more minutes, then Hyman says, "You know Rebecca, we certainly aren't getting any younger."

They maintain their silent rocking for some more minutes, then Hyman continues, "You know Rebecca, I’ve been thinking. One of these days, one of us is surely going to die."

They maintain their silent rocking a bit longer, then Hyman says, "You know Rebecca, if one of us does die, I'm going to take that trip to Israel we promised ourselves."

One night, Moshe and Sadie, both in their eighties, go to Blooms Restaurant. Moshe orders just one plate of salt beef, latkes and new green cucumbers. Then, when it arrives, he tucks into his favourite food. Sadie just sits there watching him enjoy himself.

Shlomo, sitting at a table nearby, notices that Sadie hasn’t got a meal. He then gets quite upset when, with plenty of food still left on his plate, Moshe puts down his knife and fork, removes his napkin and puts it on the table.

“How mean,” thought Shlomo, “the elderly lady is just sitting there without any food. Maybe they can’t afford two meals?”

So Shlomo goes over to Sadie and says, “I hope you won’t be offended but I see you don’t have anything to eat. Could I please treat you to a meal? It would really make me happy if you said yes.”

Sadie replies, “That’s very kind of you but there is no need to worry about me. My husband Moshe and I share everything 50/50 and now that he’s eaten his half, it will soon be my turn.”

“So what are you waiting for?” asks Shlomo.

“The teeth.”

“But of course you can, Issy,” came the reply. “Why didn’t you say so in the first place? When is the event due?”

“About nine months after I get home.”

### #969 It’s not my fault

Jacob is in court facing the judge. The judge says to him, “It has been brought to my attention that you are now 4 months behind with your alimony. Do you realise that this is a serious omission?”

“Yes, your honour, but let me explain,” replies Jacob, “It’s all because my second wife Judith isn’t very well at the moment and she can’t work too hard.”

### #970 Jewish Women’s Shopping Centre (JWSC)

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following joke]

Rivkah goes to the new shopping centre in Hendon. It’s unique because it’s only for Jewish women looking for Jewish husbands. Potential husbands are the only goods on display. This is why Rivkah is there.

When she enters the building, there is a large sign, which says: -

### #971 Reductions

Moshe’s haberdashery business was doing very badly and he decided he had to reduce his staffing level by two if he wanted to survive. So two had to go. But it didn’t help for long and he soon had to let another two go, and then soon after that, another two. Moshe died not long afterwards. All who knew him said that the terrible strain of running his business contributed to his death.

Later, as they were carrying Moshe’s body to his grave, Moshe suddenly pushed off the lid, sat up in his coffin and asked, “How many men are carrying me?”

“Eight,” came the reply.

“Better lay off two,” said Moshe, lying down again.

### #972 Silence is not golden

Bernie and Estelle had a big argument, which ended with neither one speaking to the other. This ‘silence’ went on for three days. But then Bernie realised he needed Estelle’s help because he had an early morning flight to catch. However, he still couldn’t bring himself to talk to her so he wrote a note and left it on her pillow.

It said, "Please wake me at 5 am. I have to catch an early plane."

Next morning, Bernie woke and found to his horror that it was 9 am. He heard Estelle busy in the kitchen and there was a note on his pillow.

It said, "It's 5 am. Wake up."

### #973 Sneaky

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following joke]

Sam goes into a barber’s shop and asks, "How long before I can get a haircut?"

Issy looks around his shop and replies, "About 30 minutes."

Sam thanks him and leaves.

Two days later, Sam again enters the shop, "How long before I can get a haircut?"

Issy looks around at the shop full of customers and says, "About 45 minutes."

Sam again thanks him and leaves.

A week later, Sam sticks his head into the shop and asks, "How long before I can get a haircut?"

Issy looks around his shop and says, "About 35 minutes."

Sam once again thanks him and leaves.

Issy is bewildered by this strange behaviour so he says to his assistant, "Could you please follow that man and let me know where he goes. He keeps asking me how long he would have to wait for a haircut but doesn't return."

Five minutes later, his assistant comes back, laughing aloud. Issy asks him, "So where did the guy go when he left here?"

The assistant looks at Issy and replies, "Your house."

### #974 The mermaid

It’s Sunday morning, and as usual, Abe, Issy and Benny are out fishing. Suddenly, Benny catches a mermaid. The mermaid begs him to set her free. In return, she will grant each of them a wish.

Abe doesn't believe her and says, "If you can really grant wishes, double my IQ."

The mermaid says, "Done."

Shazzam. Abe starts reciting Shakespeare flawlessly and analyses what he's recited with great insight.

Issy is amazed and says to the mermaid, "Triple my IQ."

The mermaid says, "Done."

Shazzam. Issy starts to spout solutions to problems that have been puzzling the greatest scientists of the world - the mathematicians, atomic physicists and chemists.

Benny sees the changes in his friends, so he says to her, "Quintuple my IQ."

The mermaid looks at him with a worried look and says, "You know, I normally don't try to change people's minds when they make a wish, but in this case, I really think you should reconsider. You just don't know what you're asking for. It will change your entire view of life as you now know it. Please, ask for something else. Ask for £1m and I’ll give it to you. Ask for anything, please."

Benny replies, "I hear what you’re saying but I’ll take the chance. I want you to increase my IQ to five times its usual power. If you don't, I won't set you free."

So the mermaid sighs and says, "Done."

Shazzam.  Benny turns into a woman.

### #975 Far reaching

[My thanks to Ian & Jackie for the following joke]

Three senior citizens - Sarah, Becky and Estelle, are sitting on a park bench in Golders Green having a quiet chat when a flasher approaches. He walks up to the bench, stands right in front of them and all of a sudden, with a loud shout, “AHA”, he opens his raincoat.

Sarah immediately has a stroke. Becky also has a stroke. But Estelle, who is much older and feebler than the other two, couldn't reach that far.

Abe’s father is a widower and a multi-millionaire. He also has a terminal illness and is likely to pass away soon. Abe, a single man, decides he needs a woman with whom to enjoy his soon-to-be-received fortune and where better to find one than in a single’s bar.

With luck, on his first visit, Abe meets Rifka, a woman whose beauty literally takes his breath away.

"I'm just a standard kind of a nice guy," he says to her, "but in a week or two’s time my dear father is expected to die and I'll inherit over £20 million."

Rifka goes home with Abe and the following day becomes his stepmother.

### #977 Dangerous driver

[My thanks to Hilary Ash for the following joke]

Sharon and her friend Kitty, two little elderly ladies, are out for a drive in a large Mercedes with Kitty driving and Sharon in the front passenger seat. After a few minutes, they come to some traffic lights but although the lights are clearly at red, the car just continues across the intersection.

Sharon says to herself, "I must be losing it. I could have sworn we just went through a red light."

A few minutes later, they come to another set of lights and again they go through red, this time narrowly missing a car driving across them. Although Sharon is sure the light was at red, she is still convinced she is losing it. She is now getting very nervous.

At the next intersection, the light is again showing red and as before, the car goes across without slowing.

So Sharon turns to Kitty and says, "Hey, did you know that you just passed 3 red lights in a row? What on earth are you doing – are you trying to kill us?"

Kitty turns to Sharon and replies, "Oy vay! Am I driving?"

### #978 Customer is always right

[My thanks to Hilary Ash for the following joke]

Moshe is in his usual nasty mood as he goes into a bank and says to the women cashier behind the window, "I want to open a bloody deposit account."

The astonished woman replies, "I do beg your pardon, but I must have misheard you. What did you say?"

"So listen carefully this time, you stupid moo," shouts Moshe, angrily, "I said I want to open a bloody deposit account and right now."

"I'm very sorry sir, but I won’t tolerate that kind of language," and with that she leaves her window and goes to see the bank manager.

The manager agrees with her that she certainly shouldn’t have to listen to foul language. They both return to her window and the manager says to Moshe, "What seems to be the problem, sir?"

"There is no damn problem," Moshe says, "I’ve just won £10 million on the lottery and all I want to do is open a bloody deposit account in this bloody awful bank!"

"Oh, I see, " says the manager, "and is this bitch giving you a hard time?"

### #979 The helpers

[My thanks to Ian & Jackie for the following joke]

One Sabbath, at the end of the service, Rabbi Cohen announces to his Hendon congregation that he would not be renewing his contract and that he would be moving on to a larger synagogue in the West End for more money.  There is immediate silence. He is a popular Rabbi and most of the congregation (but not all - after all he’s a Rabbi) are unhappy to hear this news.

Suddenly Moshe, who owns several very successful kosher restaurants, gets up and shouts out,  "If Rabbi Cohen agrees to stay with us, I'll provide him and his family with a free 3 course meal every day for the next 2 years."

Then Abe, a successful property tycoon, stands up and shouts, "If Rabbi Cohen stays, I'll not only increase his salary by 50% but I’ll also guarantee the education of his two children."

Then Sadie, aged 75, stands up and shouts, "And if Rabbi Cohen stays, I'll promise him sex."

Rabbi Cohen, blushing, asks her, "Sadie, why on earth did you say that?"

Sadie replies, "Because I’ve just asked my husband how we could help and he said, "Screw him."

### #980 The indiscretion

[My thanks to Ian & Jackie for the following joke]

Rebecca walks into an up-market car showroom.  As she is browsing around, she spots a special looking car and walks over to inspect it. Rebecca opens the driver’s door and bends down to feel the fine leather upholstery. Suddenly, a loud fart escapes her.

Rebecca is very embarrassed and looks nervously around, hoping that no one had noticed her little ‘indiscretion’. But as luck would have it, when she turns back to the car, there, standing next to her is a salesman.

"Good afternoon, madam, can I be of service?"

Very uncomfortably, Rebecca asks, "Yes. What is the price of this lovely car?"

"If you farted just touching it, madam," he replies, "you will sh*t yourself when you hear the price."

### #981 The new golf course

[My thanks to Ian & Jackie for the following joke]

Maurice wakes up one morning feeling lousy. "Becky, he shouts, "I’m feeling terrible, I’m sore all over, what should I do?

"So go see Doctor Myers," she replies.

After a thorough examination Doctor Myers says, "I am sorry to have to tell you this Maurice, but I have bad news for you. You’re very ill and in my opinion you don't have very long to live - anything from a few days to 3 months. I suggest you go home and make the necessary arrangements."

Maurice is devastated.

Later that evening, after the crying is over, Maurice tells Becky that as he is a devoted golfer, he would like to be buried with his golf clubs. If there’s a golf course in heaven, he would then have his clubs to play with."

But Becky says, "Maurice, as neither of us knows if there is a golf club up in heaven, I think you should go see Rabbi Levy and ask for his opinion."

Maurice goes to see Rabbi Levy. "Rabbi, is there a golf course in heaven?"

Rabbi Levy says, "I’ll speak to God for you. Come back in a few days time."

Two days later, Maurice returns. "Rabbi, have you any news?”

Rabbi Levy says, "Yes, Maurice, I have spoken to God and I have some good news and some bad news for you. The good news is that God says there is the most wonderful golf course you could imagine in heaven. The sun shines every day, 365 days a year and you can play golf to your heart’s content."

Maurice says, "That's wonderful news, Rabbi, but what's the bad news?"

Rabbi Levy replies, "Tomorrow morning 8 o'clock - you tee off."

### #982 Double trouble

Issy goes with Sarah to his local opticians in Hendon to buy a new pair of glasses for himself. He chooses a pair ‘off-the shelf’, pays for them and leaves wearing them. As they are a bit hungry, they decide to have a coffee and a sandwich at a nearby restaurant.

As he is looking through the menu, Issy says, "Sarah, you better order for me. I’m seeing everything double with my new glasses. And while you’re doing that, I’m going to the toilet."

When Issy returns, Sarah notices that the front of his trousers are wet.

"Oy Vay," says Sarah, "what happened Issy?  Your trousers are all wet?"

"You wouldn’t believe it," Issy replies, "I was standing in front of the urinal and when I looked down, I saw two. So I put one back!"

"No," replies Sadie, "no, it wasn't Sam."

"So was it Abe, that degenerate old man?"

"No, it certainly wasn’t him."

"Then it must have been that simpleton Moshe."

### #987 The solution

Melvyn and Max were left quite a large plot of land by their rich father. However, this caused the two sons much grief. For months they argued long and hard over how the land should be divided between them. The solution just wasn’t that simple, so they took their problem to Rabbi Landau.

"Rabbi," said Melvyn, "can you please help us solve our problem?"

As soon as he had heard their case, Rabbi Landau said, "Come back tomorrow and we'll talk again."

The next day, Melvyn and Max returned and the rabbi gave them his solution. He gave Max a 50p coin and said, "You can toss the coin."

"And you," said Rabbi Landau to Melvyn, "can call it, heads or tails. Whoever wins the toss will divide the land."

"But that won’t work," said Max, "we'll be right back from where we started."

"But not," said Rabbi Landau, "if the one who wins the toss divides the land and the other one gets first choice!"

### #988 A little change

On his way back from work one evening, Benny gets hit by a car as he crosses Threadneedle Street and is knocked unconscious. To the bystanders, he looks in a bad way. A Priest happens to be passing and not knowing Benny’s religion, administers last rites. But immediately, Benny's eyes open and he’s quickly fully awake.

"What were you saying to me?" asks Benny.

The Priest tells him about the last rites.

"I suppose a little bit of a different religion won’t hurt," says Benny, "thanks."

Benny can’t wait to tell his family about his experience.

When he gets home, he says to his wife, "Yetta, you won't believe what’s just happened to me."

But she tells him, "Later, Benny, later. I don't have time. I’m late for my supervision meeting. I’ve left your dinner in the oven. See you later."

So Benny goes up to his daughter’s room and says, "Leah, you won't believe what’s just happened to me."

But she says, "Sorry, Dad, I’m on the phone planning my weekend. Could you please come back later, and close the door behind you, will you."

He then goes to look for his son who he finds driving the car out the garage.

"Maurice, you won't believe what’s just happened to me."

But his son says, "Dad, I’m late for a date. I need the car and some money. Can you lend me £100 please? I’ll talk to you tomorrow."

So Benny goes back into his house, shakes his head and says, "I’ve only been a gentile for two hours and already I hate three Jews."

### #989 Conversation with mother

“Can I leave the children with you tonight, mum?”

“Why, are you going out?”

“Yes I am.”

“So aren’t you going to tell your mother who you’re going out with?”

“Oh I’m just going out with a friend.”

“I don't know why you left your husband, he was so good to you.”

“But you know I didn't leave him, mum, he left me!”

“I think you let him leave you and now you go out with anybody.”

“I don’t go out with anybody. So, can I bring the children over or not?”

“I never left you to go out with anybody except your father.”

“There are many things that you did that I don't do.”

“So, what are you hinting at?”

“Nothing mum. I just need to know if I can bring the children over tonight.”

“You're staying the night with him? What would your husband say if he knew?”

“My ex-husband wouldn’t care. From the day he left, he never slept alone!”

“So, you're going to sleep over at this loser's place?”

“He's not a loser.”

“Any man who goes out with a divorcee with children is a loser.”

”I don't want to argue with you mum. Should I bring over the children or not?”

“Poor children, with such a mother.”

“A mother such as what?”

“With no stability. No wonder your husband left you.”

“MUM. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY!”

“Please don't scream at me. You probably scream at this loser too.”

“So now you're worried about the loser?”

“Ah, you admit he's a loser, then. I guessed he was a loser straight away.”

“Goodbye mother.”

“Wait! Don't hang up. What time are you bringing them over?”

“I'm not bringing them over because I'm not going out.”

“But darling, if you don’t go out, how do you expect to meet anyone?”

"Rebecca, did you know that Naomi passed away last week?"

"No, Becky, I didn't know," replies Rebecca, "How did Abe, that stupid husband of hers, take it?"

"Hard, Rebecca, very hard," says Becky, "but not as hard as Isaac, their lodger, who everyone knew was having an affair with Naomi. Rumour has it that when Naomi died, Isaac just went to pieces. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep and he just sat around the house crying buckets."

"So then what happened?" asks Rebecca.

"I'll tell you what happened," answers Becky, "a few days after the funeral, that stupid Abe said to Isaac, "Stop your crying Isaac. Don’t worry. I'll get married again!"

### #994 Roman salesman

[My thanks to Ian Sarsby for the following joke]

Marcus Brutus Goldstein earned his living in the great market of ancient Rome. He was a tailor and made togas which he would sell from his market stall. His marketing ploy was to shout out his wares for sale, "Togas! Come buy your togas here - the finest togas in all of Rome!"

Unfortunately, business was not good.

His friend Moshe suggested that the problem was due to the cold weather. He should therefore line the garments with a fine quality wool lining.

Marcus Brutus Goldstein decided to use the finest quality Kashmir linings. From that day on, he could be heard plying his trade in the market, shouting to passers-by,  "Kashmir in togas!"

### #995 Late home

Morris and Sadie are having matrimonial problems. Morris runs a small video rental shop and he regularly comes home late from work. As a result, Sadie has to throw away his dinner most nights. Realising her unhappiness, Morris constantly promises her that he will be home in time for dinner, but somehow something always crops up to keep him working late. He really loves Sadie but, after all, times are hard and he has to make a living as well. He just can’t help it.

One morning, Sadie says, "Morris, if you’re not home by 7pm tonight, then I will never cook for you again and our marriage will be in jeopardy."

This ultimatum frightens Morris and he is determined to be home on time for once. So he closes his shop an hour early and sets off for the station. But before he gets there, he is hit by a car and is taken to hospital. Fortunately, his injuries are not too severe and he’s quite quickly released. Nevertheless, a trip to hospital plus tests, X rays and waiting for a doctor takes time and he doesn’t arrive home until 9pm.

Sadie was fuming mad. "What time do you call this?" she shouted, "you said you would be home by 7pm."

"I know I did, darling, " he replied, "but I have an excuse. I was run over by a car on my way home to you. "

"Nu, so it takes 2 hours to get run over?"

As usual, Sidney arrives home at 6.30pm, takes off his coat, turns on the TV and sits down in his favourite chair. This time, however, he turns to Leah and says, "Make me a cup of tea straight away before it starts."

Leah is surprised by this but makes him his cup of tea anyway. Sidney finishes his tea then turns to Leah and says, " Make me another cup of tea straight away. I think it’s going to start very soon."

This time Leah is quite angry, but still makes him another cup of tea. Sidney empties his cup then again turns to Leah and says, "Quickly, another cup before it starts."

At this, Leah loses her cool. "That's the last straw, you rude, inconsiderate pig," she shouts, "you come home, don’t say one word to me, put your fat toches in your armchair and then expect me to act like your servant. Does it ever occur to you that I might be tired, with all the cleaning, washing, ironing, shopping and cooking I do to keep this house of ours spotlessly clean?  I don’t think you ever give me a thought. Selfish, that’s what you are. You don’t need a wife, you need a slave, you need someone to …….."

### #1000 Family help

After a short illness, little Jeremy died. He was only 9 years old. At his funeral, his family and friends wept at his grave. Rayne, his mother, was inconsolable and was crying heavily as the gravediggers started to cover his coffin with earth.

"Oh my poor darling Jeremy. Why did you leave me at such a young age? You didn’t even get a chance to become a doctor. So bubbeleh, when you get to heaven, don’t forget to tell God how terribly miserable all those you left behind are, especially your mother. And while you’re talking to him, please ask him to help your dear father find a good job so that he can properly support me and your brothers and sisters. And Jeremy, bubbeleh, you must tell God about my back problems and my flatulence and ask him to cure me. And Jeremy, my darling baby, maybe if you told him also of your uncle’s in-growing toenail, maybe he could find time to cure him also. And, bubbeleh, don’t forget to tell God that your elder sister Sarah is already 24 years old and still hasn’t found a husband – maybe he can make her less fussy and help her find a nice property developer to marry?  Oh, and Jeremy, my sweet child, ask…………"

One of the gravediggers had heard enough. He turned to Rayne and said, "With all the problems you and your family have, Mrs Levy, you shouldn’t send a young boy to sort them out, you should go and sort things out in person."

### #1002 Business lesson number 1

Some company executives meet at a school reunion. One of them, Moshe, arrives in a chauffer-driven Rolls Royce. Moshe has with him a beautiful young woman and she is dressed in very expensive clothes.

All evening Moshe donates and spends money as if there were no tomorrow. His friends quickly realise that he is very rich and so they ask him how he has managed to become so wealthy.

“Moshe, Don’t be offended but we never thought you would be successful. How did you do it? Please tell us.”

“I don’t mind telling you,” replies Moshe, “I’m in manufacturing and I’ve got a successful product which costs me just £1 to make. I sell all I can produce for £5 and you’d be surprised how quickly 5% adds up.”

### #1003 Business lesson number 2

Hyman emigrates to England and sets up Kosher Tailors Ltd. He starts with making alterations and then moves into bespoke suits. Over time, his 3 sons join him and the company grows and prospers. Soon, the company is exceedingly profitable and his sons want to float KTL on the Stock Exchange.

“Dad,” they say, “we need to establish a financial basis for KTL. How should we determine costs and assets? How do we establish value?”

Hyman thinks for a while, then replies, “Go down to the basement and bring me the box behind the old boiler. You should find some flat irons inside the box. Then go upstairs and bring down the old tailor’s dummy behind the door. You will also find an old treadle sewing machine upstairs together with an ironing board. Bring these also to me.”

The sons do as they were told.

Hyman looks at the old instruments and says, “These are what I started with. Everything else is profit.”

### #1004 Men from the HJVFC

[My thanks to Hilary Ash for the following]

One evening, just outside Golders Green, a fire starts inside Shmatta Ltd, the leading clothing factory in north London and within minutes becomes a fierce fire.

As soon as the first fire engine arrives on the scene, Jacob goes over to the firemen and says, "Please. I’m the chief executive of this factory. All our next season’s designs are in my office in the centre of the building. They must be saved. I’ll give you £25,000 if you can save them."

Even though the thought of the money encourages the men to take risks, the strong, hot flames keep them from going inside. When two more fire engines arrive, Jacob shouts out that the offer is now £50,000 to the team who saves the design files.

Then, from the bottom of Golders Green Road, a single siren is heard and a fourth fire engine comes rushing up the hill towards the fire. From the initials on the front, HJVFC, everyone knows it’s from the Hendon Jewish Volunteer Fire Company, whose members are all over 65. But how can they possibly help? To everyone's amazement, the old-fashioned HJVFC fire engine doesn’t stop outside the building but drives straight into the middle of the fire.

As everyone watches, the elderly Jewish firemen jump down from their engine and begin fighting the fire with unbelievable energy and commitment. Five minutes later, the men from HJVFC have extinguished the fire and save the

secret designs. Jacob keeps to his bargain and writes out a cheque to HJVFC for £50,000. He then personally thanks each one of the elderly fire fighters and in particular, Moshe, the 75year old head of the team.

Jacob asks him, "What are you going to do with all that money?"

"Vell," says Moshe, "the first thing ve are going to do is fix the brakes on our run down fire engine."

Hetty, an elderly lady, has been driving around the Brent Cross shopping centre’s car park for some time looking for a place to park when at last she finds one and stops to pull into it. Suddenly, a youngster drives his car around her and parks his smart silver Audi in her space.

Hetty is so upset that she gets out of her car and says to the young driver, "I was going to park there!"

As he walks away, the man just laughs and says, "That's what you can do when you're young and quick."

Well, this really infuriates Hetty. She gets back into her car, backs it up and then drives it at speed straight into his Audi. The youngster runs back to his damaged car and asks, "What did you do that for?"

Hetty smiles and replies, "That's what you can do when you're old and rich."

### #1008 Hungry salesman

Benny the salesman had been driving all day and now it was getting dark, so he stopped for the night at a small hotel. He went to reception and a lady came to the desk. There didn’t seem to be anyone at the hotel - the place was deserted.

"Can I help you?" she asked.

"A room please and something to eat," Benny said, "I’m dying of hunger."

She looked at him and didn't like what she saw. He was sweaty, tired looking with bags under his red eyes and his suit was badly creased. It didn’t look like he could afford a meal.

So she said, "I'm sorry, sir, but we're right out of food."

Benny looked straight at her and said, "In that case, I'm going to have to do what my father did."

Immediately she grew frightened. "What did your father do?" she asked.

"My father," Benny replied, "did what he had to do."

She became even more frightened when she heard this. Who knows what kind of father this madman had? Maybe his father was a thief or a rapist even. And she was alone with him. So maybe I should keep him happy.

"Hold on sir," she said and returned with a plate full of roast beef, potatoes, hot peppers and slices of rye bread.

She watched in amazement as Benny ate it all in quick time. When he had emptied his plate, he said, "That was great, the best meal I've had in weeks."

Seeing that he was now relaxed, she asked the question that had been worrying her for the last hour. "Could you please tell me what it was that your father did?"

"Oh yes, my father," said Benny, "whenever my father couldn't get anything to eat -- he went to bed hungry."

### #1009 Misunderstanding

David went up to his nursery school teacher and said, "Teacher, I found a cat yesterday."

The teacher said, "That’s nice David. Was it dead or alive?"

"Dead," replied David.

"How do you know that?" she asked him.

"Because," said David innocently, "I pissed in its ear and it didn't move a bit."

"You did WHAT?" said the teacher, very surprised.

"You know, teacher," explained David, "I leaned over it and went 'pssst' and it didn't move."

### #1011 Thinking ahead

Little Simon has been naughty and is sent to bed by his father. He has only been in bed for a few minutes when he shouts downstairs, "Daddy, oh daddy."

"What do you want?" asks his father.

"I'm thirsty daddy," replies Simon, "can you bring me up a glass of water?"

"No," says his father, "you had your chance earlier. Now get to bed and turn off the light."

A few minutes later, "Daddy, oh daddy"

"WHAT DO YOU WANT?" shouts his father.

"I told you, daddy, I'm very thirsty. Can I please have a drink of water?"

"I’ve already told you the answer. If you ask again, you’ll be punished."

Again, a few minutes later, "Daddy, oh daddy"

"WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?" shouts his father.

"When you come upstairs to punish me, daddy, can you bring a drink of water with you?"

Rebecca takes her boyfriend Howard to see her parents to allow them to ‘pass judgement’ on him.

"Hello Howard," says her father, "it’s nice to meet you. Where do you live?"

"Near Finchley," he replies.

"Near Finchley?" interrupts Rebecca, "He’s too modest, dad. He owns a 10 bedroom mansion with 5 acres of land in Hampstead Garden Suburb."

"Well, that’s nice, Howard," says her father, "so what do you do for a living?"

"Oh, I own a bit of property," he answers.

"A bit of property?" interrupts Rebecca again, "why, Howard owns 10% of the Brent Cross shopping centre and much of the new City Docklands development."

"Well, that’s nice, Howard," says her father, "so what are your future prospects?"

"Oh, I’m planning to expand a bit," replies Howard.

"Expand a bit?" interrupts Rebecca for the third time, "why, Howard’s just about to purchase the old London Stock Exchange tower so that he can convert it into the world’s most expensive hotel."

"Well, that’s nice, Howard," says her father.

Just then Howard sneezes and reaches into his pocket for his handkerchief. Rebecca’s mother immediately asks him, "Have you got a cold, Howard?"

Before he could answer, Rebecca says, "A cold? Don’t be silly mum, Howard’s got full blown pneumonia."

### #1016 Compared to what?

Issy has six daughters, all married but one – and she is not very beautiful. So one day Issy visits Rabbi Levine. "Rabbi, I don’t know what to do about Becky. She seems to be too ugly for the men around here to want to marry. What do you suggest I do?"

"First of all, can I ask you how ugly Becky is?" says Rabbi Levine.

"Well, Rabbi, if she was lying on a plate with some herrings, I don’t think she would stand out from the herrings."

"OK, " says Rabbi Levine, "what kind of herrings are we talking about?"

Surprised by the question, Issy replies, "Err….Bismarck herrings Rabbi."

"That’s really bad luck, then," says Rabbi Levine, "if they were Maatjes herrings, she’d have a much better chance."

### #1018 A year in the life

As Sadie and Manny are leaving Brent Cross shopping centre, they see their neighbour’s son Paul and his fiancée Sharon just going in.

"Did you see that? " Sadie says.

"See what?" asks Manny, pretending not to know what Sadie is referring to.

"Paul’s fiancée, that’s who,” Sadie says, "She’s dressing all wrong. She’s probably 37-23-35 and with big breasts like hers, she shouldn’t be wearing such a skimpy see-through top. And such a tight leather skirt she’s wearing - I don’t know how she can breathe properly. And it’s so short, it make her legs look too long. I know she’s got a beautiful face but I don’t think blonde dyed hair suits her. Believe me, Manny, that marriage won’t last more than 1 year."

With a deep sigh, Manny replies, "Please God I should have such a year."

### #1019 Barmitzvah present

Avrahom is a 12year old known for his total lack of religious study, so when his barmitzvah day arrives, Rabbi Bloom is not about to let this go without comment. Avrahom performs his barmitzvah as best he can with his minimal preparation and when it comes time to receive his presents, Avrahom gets what most barmitzvah boys are given - a daily prayer book; a set of Jewish Festivals prayer books; a kiddush cup from the congregation’s ladies guild; an encyclopaedia - “The History of the Jewish People from Bible Times to the Present”; and a bible (old testament).

Rabbi Bloom then addresses the barmitzvah boy, "My dear Avrahom. You have received today a number of treasures of Judaism in book form that will surely enrich your life and make it holy in the eyes of God. I also have a gift for you."

With that, Rabbi Bloom pulls out an umbrella from behind the lectern and says to Avrahom, "I present you with this umbrella because I want to give you something that at least I know for certain you will open."

### #1020 A story for the chronologically challenged

It’s Fay’s 80th birthday and she decides to celebrate it on her own at the Savoy Hotel because they make good drinks there. As soon as she arrives, Fay goes into the bar and orders a whiskey with 2 drops of water.

As the barman gives her the drink, Fay tells him, "I'm 80 years old today, you know."

The barman says, "As it's your birthday, this drink is on me."

"Thank you," says Fay, and she quickly finishes her drink.

Then a woman next to her says, "I’d like to buy you a drink, too."

"Why thanks," says Fay, "barman, a whiskey with 2 drops of water, please."

"Coming right up," says the barman. Fay again knocks back her drink.

Then a man next to her says, "Mazeltov, madam, may I too buy you a drink?"

"Why yes," says Fay, "barman, a whiskey with 2 drops of water please."

As he hands her the drink, the barman says, "Excuse me for asking but why the whiskey with only 2 drops of water? I'm dying to know."

Fay replies, "It’s simple - when you're my age, you know how to hold your liquor, but take it from me, water is something altogether different!"

### #1021 The charges

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following]

Sarah and Max get married. On their wedding night, just when Max is highly aroused, Sarah surprises him by demanding £25 for their lovemaking. Max readily agrees.

Over the next 30 years, this scenario is repeated each time they make love - and lovemaking is very frequent because they are both passionate people. Max always regards the payment as a cunning way to let Sarah buy new clothes and go regularly to the hairdressers.

One day, Sarah arrives home just after lunch to find Max at home. He is stressed out and in tears. He tells her, "My company’s been taken over and I’ve been made redundant. What on earth will I do? I’m not young anymore and finding another job quickly will be difficult."

Without saying a word, Sarah opens her bureau and hands Max her Nationwide Building Society passbook. When he opens it, he’s surprised to see it showing deposits plus interest over 30 years totalling nearly £1 million.  Sarah then hands him share certificates worth nearly £2 million and says, "Darling Max. For the last 30 years, I’ve been carefully investing my ‘£25 lovemaking charges’ and what you see is the result of my investments. So we don’t need to worry about money."

When he hears this, Max gets even more distraught and agitated than before, so Sarah asks him, "Why are you so upset at such good news, Max?"

Max replies, "Oy vay. If I had known what you were doing, I would have given you all of my business."

"Isaac," says the teacher, "why haven’t you written anything?"

"Because if I had a million pounds, Miss, that's exactly what I would do - nothing."

### #1023 Canine agent

One day whilst out walking in Golders Green, Max sees a sign in front of a house, "Talking Dog for Sale."  He’s curious so he rings the bell. The owner tells Max the dog’s name is Cindy. He then takes Max into the back garden where a cavalier King Charles spaniel is just sitting there.

"Do you really talk?"  Max asks Cindy.

"Yes, of course I do," Cindy replies.

"So what can you tell me about yourself."

Cindy looks up at Max and says, "I discovered this special gift of speech when I was young and as I’ve always wanted to help my country, I told MI5 about it. In next to no time, they had me flying all over the world, sitting in rooms not only with royalty and world leaders but also with spies. No one figured a dog could be eavesdropping, so I was their most valuable spy.  But all the jetting around really tired me out. I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down.  So I resigned and signed up for a job at Heathrow airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious people and listening in to their conversations. As a result, I uncovered some incredible plots and deals and received seven doggie awards.  I had a husband and many puppies. Now, I'm retired."

Max is amazed and asks the owner how much he wants for Cindy.

The owner says, "£20."

Max says, "This dog is amazing.  Why on earth are you selling her so cheap?"

The owner replies, "Because Cindy is a liar - she didn't do any of the things she told you."

### #1024 The benefactor

Issy the millionaire goes to Synagogue one shabbes and at the end of the service stops to shake Rabbi Levy’s hand.

Rabbi Levy replies, "Why thank you Issy, but I'd rather you didn't use that kind of language in the Lord's House."

But Issy continues, "In fact I was so God-damned impressed with your sermon that I’ve decided to send you £10,000 for the synagogue rebuilding fund."

Rabbi Levy replies, "No sh*t?"

### #1025 The doctor’s bill

Morris the Edgware tailor is worried because his wife Hetty is very ill and needs a good doctor. Everyone knows that Dr Myers is the best doctor in Edgware, so Morris rings him to say that he would like him to treat Hetty.

Dr Myers says, “OK, but can you afford me? What if I’m unable to save Hetty and you decide not to pay my bills?”

Morris replies, “I promise to pay you anything, no matter whether you cure Hetty or kill her.”

So Dr Myers agrees to treat Hetty. Unfortunately, Hetty dies soon after. When Dr Myers invoice arrives, Morris refuses to pay, despite his promise. After much arguing, they agree to take the issue to their Rabbi for a decision.

Dr Myers puts his side of the story to the Rabbi. “He promised to pay me, ‘no matter whether I cured his wife or killed her.’”

After a few minutes deliberation, the Rabbi says, “So did you cure her?”

Dr Myers has to reply, “No.”

The Rabbi then asks, “So did you kill her?”

“No, I certainly did not,” replied Dr Myers.

“In that case,” says the Rabbi, “Morris owes you nothing – you fulfilled neither of the conditions on which you agreed that your fee should be paid.”

### #1029 £35 is £35

[My thanks to Stan Cohen for the following]

Manny and his wife Ethel go to the Farnborough Air Display every year. Every year, Manny says, "Ethel, I'd like to take a ride in a plane," and every year she replies, "I know, but a ride in a plane is expensive."

At this year’s Air Display, as Manny and Ethel are walking past the plane ride, Manny says, "Ethel, I'm getting old. If I don't go up in that plane today, I’ll never get another chance."

Ethel replies, "But Manny, that ride costs £35 and £35 is £35 you know."

The pilot hears their conversation, "Hey you two, I'll make a deal with you. I'll take you both up for a ride and if you can both stay absolutely silent for the entire trip, I won't charge you a thing. But if I hear just one sound, I’ll charge you £35."

Manny and Ethel talk it over and agree to the offer. So up they go.

The pilot tries very hard to get them to shout out in fear - he puts the plane in a series of dives; he twists and turns the plane at speed; he even rolls the plane on its back, but he doesn’t hear a sound from his elderly passengers.

When they land, the pilot turns to Manny and says, "You’re very brave, I tried everything to make you shout out aloud, but you didn't utter a word."

Manny replies, "Thanks, but to be honest, I was going to say something when Ethel fell out, but £35 is £35 you know."

### #1030 The job seeker

Stan is nearly 60 and for many years now, he’s been regularly going to his local job centre every Tuesday. Every time he goes, he picks up his jobseekers allowance - he’s never been known to actually look for a job.

It’s Tuesday again. Stan walks up to the desk and says to the clerk, "Good morning. What job do you have for me? As you know, I never like claiming any benefits or allowances – I’m not a sponger. I think it’s far better to look for a good job."

The clerk is surprised to hear this, but replies, "You’re really in luck today, Stan. We’ve just received instructions from a very wealthy man who wants a bodyguard / chauffeur for his nymphomaniac daughter. It says here that the hours are very long, but in return, you'll get to wear smart suits, shirts, ties and shoes, all of which will be provided free of charge. Meals will also be provided. You will get to drive a big Lexus when you’re not working and you’ll have to escort the young lady on her many overseas trips. The salary package is £100,000 a year plus expenses."

Stan says, "You're pulling my leg, aren’t you?"

The clerk replies, "Yes, but you started it."

“She’s doing really fine. She’s now playing her violin in almost every major concert hall around the world and we hardly see her these days.”

“And what about your youngest son?”

“Oh Issy? He’s doing OK, I suppose. He’s currently selling cheap clothing to all the street markets in central London. Mind you, if it wasn’t for Issy, we would all be starving.”

### #1035 Saved in Bournemouth

Moshe was on holiday in Bournemouth to celebrate his 70th birthday. It was a nice day so he decided to go for a swim. But he had only been out for 5 minutes when a huge wave came from nowhere and swept him out to sea.

"Oy Vay," cried Moshe, "Help! Help me someone, please. I’m drowning."

Fortunately, a lifeguard heard his cries and swam out to him. He gripped Moshe tightly and swam back to the shore with him. As soon as he got Moshe onto dry land, the lifeguard gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 5 minutes later, Moshe sat up – he was saved.

The lifeguard helped Moshe to his feet and said, "If I were you, sir, I’d take it easy for the rest of the day. Why don’t you go back to your hotel and put your feet up?"

As the lifeguard turned to walk away, Moshe whispered to a lady next to him, "Excuse me, but could you help me please. How much does one tip for a thing like that?"

### #1036 Getting back

Issy goes to see Rabbi Levy.

"Rabbi," he says, "you remember Sarah and I got divorced last year?"

"Yes Issy, I remember."

"Well Rabbi, the thing is, my friends are telling me that Sarah is feeling very sorry she divorced me. They think she wants to get back with me. What do you think I should do?"

"Nothing," said Rabbi Levy, "do absolutely nothing."

"You seem so sure about this, Rabbi. Why?"

"Yes, Issy, I am," replied Rabbi Levy. "You see, wives are very much like fishermen - complaining about the one they caught, and bragging about the one that got away."

### #1037 Coffee maker

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Maurice and Becky are arguing over who should brew the coffee each morning.

Becky says, "As you get up first in the morning, Maurice, you should make it. Then we won't have to wait too long for our coffee."

"But you’re in charge of all the cooking," replies Maurice, "that’s your job, so you should make it. And if I have to wait for my coffee in the morning, well, I don't mind."

"But it says in the bible that the man should make the coffee," says Becky

"OK, responds Maurice, "if you can show me where it says that, I’ll never question you again."

Next day, Becky borrows a bible from her neighbour and shows Maurice that on the top of several pages it indeed says ‘Hebrews’.

### #1040 He’s missing

Sadie’s husband Bernie didn’t come home from work one day. She was a bit worried because she had not received any calls from him to say he’d be late. She rang Bernie’s office, but there was no reply and she rang Bernie’s mobile, but it was switched off. By 9pm, she was very worried. She rang all the people who might have known where he was, but nobody knew. At 10pm, she decided to go to the police station and report him missing.

When she got there, she told the duty officer, "I don’t know what to do. My husband Bernie didn’t come home from work today. I can’t live without him. Please help me."

"OK, madam, " he replied, "calm down. I just need you to answer a few simple questions."

“Ask away, " she replied.

"First of all, can you describe him for me? I need this so we can put out a search for him."

"Well, officer, he’s 52 with brown eyes and dark brown hair – what’s left of it. He’s well built – well that’s not strictly true, he’s quite fat really, and he sweats a lot. He’s also got what I call an aggressively loud voice. He’s got two missing front teeth….he wears thick old fashioned glasses….and he’s…wait a minute officer, I’ve had second thoughts, maybe you shouldn’t bother looking for him."

### #1047 Forest drive

Avrahom is walking down Edgware High Street one day when a smart Lexus saloon draws up next to him. Who should be in it but his friend Yitzhak.

Avrahom asks Yitzhak, "Where did you get such a nice car, Yitzhak?"

"My girlfriend Sarah gave it to me. "

"Mazeltov. I knew Sarah has been telling everyone that she’s in love with you, but … to give you such a car?"

"Well, even I admit it was very strange," says Yitzhak. "We were out driving in Sarah’s car in Epping Forest when she suddenly drove into a small covered area hidden from the road. She then got out the car, took off all her clothes and said to me, ‘Yitzhak, take whatever you want.’"

"So I took the car."

"Oh my God," she says, as she grips her pillow tightly.

As the vampire slowly approaches her, Mary remembers the cross around her neck. She grabs it, points it towards the vampire and with a trembling cry says, "You can't come any closer. Look, I have a cross."

The vampire looks Mary in the eye and says, "Lady, Es vet dir gornisht helfen! (it won’t help you)"

### #1049 No help needed

Issy, a reform Jew, is invited to his nephew's barmitzvah. The invitation also says that they would like him to do an aliyah. Not being a regular shul goer, he learns how to do it. Everyday he practises, "barachu et hashem hamevorach... baruch hashem hamevorach leolam vaed."

On the day before the barmitzvah, he practises it one more time and when he went to sleep that night, he was confident that he knew it well.

The day of the barmitzvah arrives and soon it was his turn in the shul. He goes up and says, "barachu et hashem hamevorach."

Everyone behind him then said, "barach hashem hamevorach leolam vaed."

"SHUT UP,” he shouts, "I can do it myself!"

### #1050 The fund raisers

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Four ladies from their synagogue’s fund raising committee are driving home one Sunday afternoon when they are involved in a terrible car crash. Unfortunately, none of them survive. When they arrive at the Pearly Gates, they are kept waiting to get into Heaven because the angel at the gates can’t find them listed in the book of heavenly new arrivals. "I'm sorry," he says to them, "but I can't find you in the book."

So he has no choice but to send them down to Hell.

A week later, God visits the Pearly Gates and says to the angel, "Where are those nice Jewish ladies who were supposed to be here by now?"

"You mean the fund raisers? I didn't see them listed, so I sent them to Hell," replies the angel.

"You did what?" God says, "I wanted them here. If you don’t want to join them, you’d better call Satan and get them transferred back here right away."

So the angel phones Satan and says, "Satan, you know those Jewish ladies I sent you last week? Well we really need them up here. Could you please send them back?

"Sorry, I can’t oblige," Satan replies, "they've been down here only a week and already they’ve raised £100,000 for an air conditioning system."

"No thanks, Father," Hymie said as he sat up, "I'm not a Catholic."

"What, you’re not Catholic?" said the priest, "so why did you make the sign of the cross immediately after the car hit you?"

Hymie replied, "I was just checking."

"Checking? Checking for what?" said the priest.

"Everything important to me - spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch."

Sarah and Issy are out celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary. During the evening, Sarah broaches the subject of life insurance (his) – an issue she has been raising with him for at least 10 years, without success.

"Issy," she says, with tears in her eyes, "I don’t think you love me."

"Why do you think that?" he asks.

"Because if you really love me, you would ensure that if anything happened to you, God forbid, I would be properly provided for."

"Sarah," he says angrily, "I need life insurance like I need a hole in the head."

"I know your views," says Sarah, "but I’ve spoken to two of my friends recently and they tell me that their husbands have life insurance - and they’re not as rich as you. If it’s good enough for them, why isn’t it good enough for you?"

"I’ll tell you why," replies Issy, "it’s because they’ve been paying high premiums month after month and what have they got so far in return? Nothing, gornisht."

"So what if their husbands have been paying for nothing?" says Sarah, "You’ve always told me I’m luckier than my friends – who knows, maybe this time I’ll strike it rich."

### #1056 What a mitzvah

It’s Sunday evening and Rabbi Levy is in deep conversation with his friend.

"I must tell you something, Moshe," he says, "I made nine people very, very happy today."

"A mitzvah, Rabbi, a true mitzvah," says Moshe, "but tell me – how did you manage to achieve this?"

"I performed four marriage ceremonies in my synagogue this afternoon," replies Rabbi Levy.

Moshe is puzzled. "I can see how you made eight people happy, Rabbi, but what about the ninth?"

"Do you really believe I did all this for free?" replies Rabbi Levy.

### #1057 Insider information

Benny has been suffering with his hearing for many years and at last decides to see a doctor. After examining Benny, the doctor tells him, "I’m surprised you’ve put up with this problem for so long. All you need is a hearing aid."

Within days, Benny is fitted with a state-of-the-art hearing aid and is asked to return in 4 weeks time for a check up.

Benny returns to the doctor a month later and after another examination, the doctor says, "Your hearing is perfect, almost 100%. Your family must be really pleased that you can hear again."

Benny replies, "Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. As a result, I've changed my Will three times already."

### #1059 Knowledge is a wonderful thing

Rose has filed for divorce. When she and Sam finally attend the court hearing, the judge asks her, "So what do you find wrong with your husband?"

"Well, among other things, your honour, he lies; he’s aggressive; he steals my money; and he’s poor in bed. In fact he’s a bit of a shlemazel(*)."

"Those are serious allegations," says the judge, "can you prove them?"

"Prove them?" replies Rose, "I don’t have to, your honour, everyone knows what Sam is like."

"If you knew all of this," asks the judge, "why on earth did you marry him?"

"But I didn't know it before I married him," replies Rose.

Sam then shouts out, "She did too, your honour."

### #1060 Appreciation

Gary, a financial advisor, is talking to one of his elderly lady clients about her recent purchase of £100,000 worth of Marks and Spencer shares.

"Rivkah, do you remember your recent investment in Marks and Spencer? Well, I’ve just heard that they are going to split."

"Oy vay, vat a pity," she replies sadly, "I'm really very upset to hear about it - especially as they’ve been together for such a long time."

Rabbi Morris has just resigned and Issy, the synagogue president, goes to visit him.

"Rabbi," Issy says, "I’ve just heard the news. I’m really sorry that you’ve decided to leave us."

"Don’t worry," says Rabbi Morris, "you’ll have nothing to worry about. I’m going to recommend a successor whom I believe will be better than me."

"But that’s exactly what’s worrying me," says Issy, "your predecessor told me exactly the same thing."

### #1063 Absolutely certain

As soon as Rabbi Levy entered his office, there was Arnold waiting for him.

"I need your advice, Rabbi," says Arnold.

"OK Arnold, how can I help, what’s bothering you?" asks Rabbi Levy

"Rabbi," asks Arnold, "is it right for one man to make money from another man's errors?"

"No Arnold, it certainly isn’t," replies Rabbi Levy.

"Are you absolutely sure about that?" asks Arnold.

"About that, Arnold, I’m absolutely positive," replies Rabbi Levy.

"I’m so pleased to hear you say this, Rabbi," says Arnold, "so could you please return the £300 I gave you to marry me to my wife Sadie?"

### #1064 Reasons for divorce

Rose goes to see Max, her solicitor, and says, "I want to divorce my Harry.”

"Why do you want to do that?" Max asks, "I thought you said he was a man of rare gifts.

"He is," replies Rose, he’s never given me a present in twenty years of marriage.”

"Very funny, Rose. Is there another reason why you want a divorce?" asks Max.

"Yes there is," replies Rose, "I want a divorce because of his appearance."

"That’s an unusual reason," says Max.

"Not really," says Rose, "Harry hasn’t put in an appearance at home for four years.

### #1070 The quick thinker

Ethel and Leah meet at Brent Cross shopping centre and sit down on a bench to chat. After a few minutes have gone by, Ethel suddenly says, "Oy vay, Leah, just look at the face of that poor boy coming towards us. His mouth is so misshapen that it makes his lips stand out. And his chin – what a double chin it is. His eyes look at each other and he’s already loosing his hair."

"That boy you’ve been describing, Ethel, that boy coming towards us, he is none other than mine son Henry," says Leah, with tears in her eyes.

"Oh, is that Henry?" replies Ethel, "on him it looks good."

### #1071 A synagogue visit

Abe and Sadie make a rare appearance in synagogue. It’s probably true to say that they are not the most religious of Jews. In fact they only go to shul two or three times every year – and this is one of those days.

At the end of the service, Abe shakes Rabbi Rose’s hand and says, "Sadie and I both thoroughly enjoyed your service today, Rabbi."

Rabbi Rose replies, "It’s nice of you to say so, Abe, so why don’t you and Sadie come here more often?"

"It’s difficult," replies Abe, "but at least we keep the Ten Commandments."

"That's really good to hear," says Rabbi Rose.

"Yes," says Abe proudly, "Sadie keeps 6 of them and I keep the other 4."

### #1072 Playtime learning

### #1074 It’s a bit fishy

Isaac has just had a beautiful swimming pool built in his garden in Hampstead Garden Suburb. But his joy is short lived when a council inspector knocks on his door and asks to see the pool.

"Mr. Levy," says the inspector, "we’ve checked our records and we can’t find any evidence that you obtained council approval to build this pool. Is this correct?"

"Yes," answers Isaac, "but I didn’t know I needed permission to build in my own back garden. Is permission really required?"

"Oh yes," replies the inspector, "indeed it’s required. A swimming pool must get official sanction before it’s built. Only if it were an ornamental fish pond, say, would permission not be necessary."

"OK," says Isaac, "what you see in front of you is really an ornamental pond."

"I’m not stupid," says the inspector, "a 40metre long pool such as yours cannot be described as a pond, Mr. Levy."

"But it is a pond," argues Isaac, "indeed it is."

Then the inspector spots a filtration plant at the end of the garden. "So why is there a filter?"

"Because," replies Isaac, "it’s a gefilte fish pond."

### #1075 Wear it for 3 weeks

[My thanks to Jack L for the following]

Rivkah wakes up one morning and utters a loud "Oy Vay." She has a nagging pain in her left shoulder. She immediately goes to see her doctor.

After examining her, her doctor says, "Do you own a full length mink coat?"

"Yes doctor, mine Hymie bought me one for our silver wedding."

"Good," he says, "you must wear it for 3 weeks, then book to see me again."

Rivkah returns after three weeks and says, "Well doctor, my shoulder has cleared, but I now have a pain in my left index finger."

After examining her, he says, "Do you own a 3 or 4 carat diamond ring?"

"Yes doctor, mine Hymie bought me a 4 carat ring to celebrate the birth of Moshe, our first grandson."

"Good," he says, "you must wear it for 3 weeks, then book to see me again."

Rivkah returns after three weeks and says, "Well doctor, my finger is OK but I'm now getting terrible headaches behind my eyes."

After examining her, he says, "Do you own a platinum and diamond tiara?"

"Yes doctor, mine Hymie bought me one to wear under the chuppah at our Sarah's wedding."

"Good," he says, "you must wear it for 3 weeks, then book to see me again."

Rivkah returns after three weeks and says, "Well doctor, it’s a miracle. My shoulder feels great, my finger feels great and I'm not getting any further headaches. Thank you very, very much. But I have one question to ask you."

"What is it Rivkah?" asks her doctor.

"Doctor, how do you treat your non Jewish patients?"

### #1076 The important discussion

[My thanks to Stephen for the following]

Leah and Rose always meet every week at Brent Cross shopping centre and always end up having a light lunch at John Lewis. One day over lunch, Leah says to Rose, "All we ever seem to do is talk about the unimportant things in life. Today, for example, we’ve talked about the rudeness of our local kosher butcher, what the weather’s like in Bournemouth, and our Rabbi’s recent poor sermon. Next time we meet, why don’t we have a serious discussion on world affairs?"

"A good idea," says Rose.

So the following week, while they are waiting for their lunch to arrive, Rose says, "So lets talk already."

Leah says, "OK. What do you think about the situation with Red China?"

Rose replies, "Not much - it won’t go with your green tablecloth."

### #1080 Man versus machine

On his way to work one morning, Nathan arrives at Mill Hill station a bit early. While he’s waiting for his train, he notices a new machine on the platform – the sign on it says it’s a state-of-the-art talking weighing machine. So Nathan stands on it, puts in a £1 coin and the machine says, "You weigh 160 pounds and you are Jewish."

Nathan can’t believe what he’s just heard. So he gets on it again and inserts another £1 coin. "You weigh 160 pounds, you are Jewish and you’re waiting for the 7.35am train to take you to your job at Rothschild’s Bank."

He is totally shocked, but he’s determined to beat the machine. He goes into the Gents toilet, ruffles up his hair, puts on a pair of dark sunglasses, removes his tie, takes off his jacket and drapes it over his arm, and puts a first aid plaster on his chin.  He then goes back outside, steps on the machine and puts in another £1 coin. The machine instantly says, "You’re still Jewish and weigh 160 pounds. You’re also a shmuck(*). While you’ve been testing me out, you’ve just missed your train."

### #1082 Jewish Eskimos?

Issy and Daniel, the well-known anthropologists, were having a discussion. "Daniel, do you think there are any Jewish Eskimos about?"

"I don’t know," replies Daniel, "but why don’t we go see for ourselves?"

Two weeks later they’re in Alaska. As they ask around, they are consistently directed to one particular, very ornate igloo. When they go inside, they find a family of four Eskimos sitting around an ice table munching candles - and they weren’t ordinary candles. From the cardboard boxes on the table, Issy and Daniel could clearly see that they were Yahrtzeit candles.

Surprised by this revelation, Issy turns to the Eskimo father and says, "We’ve noticed the candles - are you Jewish by any chance?"

"No," came the reply, "we just like Jewish food."

### #1083 The homecoming surprise

Yitzhak was not the kind of person you would expect any sympathy from. Whenever something bad happened to anyone, he would always shrug his shoulders and say, "Well, look on the bright side - it could have been worse."

One day, something terrible happened to the married couple living next door to Yitzhak - the husband came home early from work and caught his wife in bed with another man, so he shot both his wife and her lover, then killed himself.

Soon, crowds began to gather in the street and many were in a state of shock. But as usual, Yitzhak shrugged his shoulders and said, "Well, look on the bright side - it could have been worse."

They all recoiled in horror. "Don’t be so stupid," they told him, "how on earth could it have been any worse?"

Yitzhak replied, "Well, if the husband had come home early yesterday instead of today, I would be dead now."

"Yes it’s true," replies Harry.

"And I also hear that she’s recently become quite ill," says Nathan.

"Yes it’s true," replies Harry.

"In fact, I hear that she’s so ill that she’s been taken into hospital," says Nathan.

"Yes its true," replies Harry.

"So how long has she been in hospital?" asks Nathan.

"In two days time, please God, it will be 2 weeks," replies Harry.

"Well," said Rabbi Samuel," we’ve installed a snack bar at the back of the synagogue for those who feel hungry or thirsty during services – we serve falafel in pitta and hot salt beef with latkes and new green cucumbers."

"That’s nothing to what we do, my friends," said Rabbi Kosiner, "we close our synagogue for the Jewish holidays."

### #1094 A woman’s lament

Becky was talking to Shlomo. "Oy vay, Shlomo."

"What’s wrong, Becky?" he asks.

"I was thinking about myself this morning and I couldn’t believe just how things have got worse now that I’m chronologically challenged(*). I'm living with osteoporosis and my kidneys are so bad that I have to have regular dialysis. I have terrible circulation in my feet and can’t feel my toes. I’ve survived a triple-heart bypass operation and had both my hips replaced. I’m loosing the sight in my right eye and my hearing is terrible. I’ve got a new left knee and the other one is deteriorating."

"And that’s not all, Shlomo. I’m sure I’m suffering from senile dementia – I can't remember whether I'm 73 or 79. I’m also sure I’m suffering from senile dementia – I can't remember whether I'm 73 or 79."

"But I continue to survive, Shlomo - at a price! As a result of the 50 daily medications I take to live from day to day, I suffer from diarrhoea, wind, dizziness and sometimes even blackouts. But, my dear Shlomo, thank God I still have my driver's license."

### #1095 Up in the air

Sadie goes to see her psychiatrist, doctor Myers, to get help on an issue concerning her sexual relationship with her husband Abe.

Doctor Myers explains, "OK, but I can only help you if you are open and honest with me. Is that agreed?"

"Yes," says Sadie.

But after just 15 minutes, doctor Myers has to tell her, "We’re getting nowhere, Sadie. You’re too secretive. I’ll try just once more – please reply quickly to the questions I’m going to ask you or I won’t be able to help."

"OK." says Sadie.

"Have you ever looked directly into Abe’s face while you were making love?" asks doctor Myers.

"Yes," replies Sadie.

"We’re making progress at last," says doctor Myers, "So tell me, Sadie, when you looked directly into Abe’s face while you were making love, did you see any emotion there?"

"Yes," replies Sadie, "I saw great anger on his face."

"Excellent," continues doctor Myers, "we’re nearly there. So when you looked directly into Abe’s face while you were making love and saw great anger, could you please explain to me exactly what Abe was doing at the time?"

Sadie replies, "He was up a ladder looking at me through the bedroom window."

### #1097 The magnificent symphony

God is so disenchanted with all the noisy earthly music he keeps on hearing that he decides to do something about it. He sits down to write a Rosh Hashanah (New Year) symphony. When he finishes, God is very pleased with his effort. It is, he says to himself, ‘a magnificent musical symphony, exactly how real music should sound.’

Now that it’s ready, God wants his symphony performed as quickly as possible, so he assembles the greatest musicians of all time and invites everyone who ever lived to hear his masterpiece.  No one could refuse.

The day of the unique concert arrives and God himself decides to conduct his own composition. He stands in front of a music stand made of solid gold, taps his baton for order and then the music begins.

The first movement lasts a whole year, but passes so quickly that no one notices. The second movement is even more beautiful than the first and even though this lasts over 2 years, no one seems to mind.

Now comes the third movement. This is the longest and loveliest of all and midway through is a special solo part - one note struck on a silver triangle. It is the highpoint of the symphony. And guess who has been personally selected by God to strike that note? It’s none other than Moshe.  Moshe’s family are so proud – it is such an honour to be chosen.

Moshe stands patiently waiting his cue - he doesn’t want to miss it. Then it comes. All the other instruments are hushed. Moshe swings and ….. Oy Gevalt, he misses.   There is no sound at all. The orchestra goes deathly quiet and a groan goes up from the audience of billions.

God taps his baton on the gold music stand for order and says, “OK everyone, lets start again from the top.”

### #1098 The gold spoon

As the catering staff are clearing up after Benjy’s barmitzvah party, they notice that one of the gold spoons is missing – and it’s the one from where Rabbi Bloom sat. So they tell the hosts, Moshe and Sadie, of the disappearance.

"Can you believe it, Sadie?" says Moshe, "But how can we call our Rabbi a gonif? We’ll just have to keep quiet about it."

12 months later, whilst out buying bagels one Sunday morning, Moshe finds himself next to his Rabbi.

"Moshe, I’m glad we’ve met," says Rabbi Bloom, "what’s the problem, why have you been avoiding me?"

Moshe replies, "Now that you ask, Rabbi, I’ve been avoiding you ever since we discovered one of our gold spoons missing from Benjy’s party."

Rabbi Bloom says, "But why didn’t you ask me about this. I put the spoon in Benjy’s tefillin bag. He obviously hasn’t opened it since his barmitzvah day."

### #1100 Progress

Hetty was just about to make herself a cup of coffee when her front doorbell rang. She opened the door and there stood a smartly dressed man.

"Good morning, madam," he said, "I’m a Jehovah Witness and …" but before he could continue, Hetty said to him, "I’m just about to make myself some coffee. Why don’t you come in and join me?"

Very surprised, he agreed.

After coffee, Hetty said, "I’m now going to have to make some lunch for myself so I don’t really have much time at this moment to talk to you. But if you’d like to join me in a bite to eat, we can talk later."

He was shocked at this kind offer. But again he agreed.

When they had finished eating, Hetty said, "OK, I’m all ears. Why don’t you start at the beginning and tell me all about the Jehovah Witness movement?"

He was totally surprised by this and replied, "I can’t tell you anything - I’ve never got this far before."

"So you must be 97?" says Rabbi Zeller.

Ruth replies, "Yes, hardly worth going back home is it?"

### #1104 A fishy story

As Moses and the children of Israel were crossing the Red Sea, the children of Israel began to complain that they were very thirsty after walking so far. They couldn’t even drink from the walls of water on either side of them because they were made up of salt-water.

Whilst Moses was looking around for some fresh water, a fish from the wall of water told him that he and his friends were willing to help. They would use their gills to remove the salt from the water and force it out of their mouths like a freshwater fountain for the Israelites to drink from as they walked by.

Moses accepted this kindly fish's offer with gratitude, but the fish said there was a condition. The children of Israel and their descendants always had to be present at the Seder meal that would be established to commemorate the Exodus, since they had a part in the story.

When Moses agreed to this, he gave the fish their name, which remains how they are known to this very day, for he said to them, "Go Filter Fish!"

### #1105 Mother’s 11th commandment

Of the beasts of the field, and of the fishes of the sea, and of all foods that are acceptable in my sight, you may eat - but not in the living room.

Of the cereal grains, of the corn and of the wheat and of the oats, and of all the cereals that are of bright colour and unknown provenance you may eat - but not in the living room.

Of frozen dessert and of all frozen after-meal treats you may eat - but absolutely not in the living room.

Of the juices and other beverages, yea, even of those in non-spill cups, you may drink - but not in the living room (and neither may you carry such therein).

Indeed, when you reach the place where the living room carpet begins, of any food or beverage there you may not eat, neither may you drink. But if you are sick and are lying down and watching something, then may you eat in the living room.

### #1115 Advice for the ladies

Rabbi Levy is addressing the ‘Enlighten Your Daughter’ meeting of the synagogue women’s guild. "Ladies," he says, "I’m sure some of you know by now that the unfortunate Jonathan Bloom has been sent to prison for making love to his wife Sadie’s dead body."

A number of ‘Oy Vays’ are heard from the ladies present.

"You might also be interested to know," the Rabbi goes on to say, "that I spoke to Jonathan yesterday and I now firmly believe that his actions were entirely innocent and accidental. So although we are all feeling sorry for Jonathan, there is a lesson to be learned.  Ladies, go back home to your daughters and tell them that when making love with a good Jewish husband, they should please make a little wiggle."

### #1116 Tradition

[My thanks to Leonie L for the following]

Rabbi Gold is conducting his very first service at one of London’s oldest synagogues. All is going well until he gets to the ‘Shema’ prayer - only half his congregation stand up. Those still seated start yelling ‘sit down’ to those standing and those standing start yelling ‘stand up’ to those sitting. Although Rabbi Bloom is knowledgeable about much of the law, he doesn’t know what to do. He thinks it must be something to do with the synagogue’s tradition.

After the service, Rabbi Bloom consults Abe, the synagogue’s oldest member. "I need to know, Abe, what the synagogue’s tradition is with regard to the Shema prayer. Is the tradition to stand during this prayer?"

Abe replies, "No, that is not the tradition."

"So the tradition is to sit during Shema?" says Rabbi Bloom.

Abe replies, "No, that is not the tradition."

"But," says Rabbi Bloom, "my congregation argue all the time. They yell at each other about whether they should sit or stand and ..."

Abe interrupts, exclaiming, "Aha, THAT is the tradition!"

### #1118 What did you say?

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Sam’s daughter says to him one day, "Dad, as you’re coming up to 80, why don’t you go see doctor Seigal and get him to give you a full medical? You haven’t been yourself ever since Mum died."

"OK," says Sam. And sure enough, a week later, he has a full health check.

Three days afterwards, doctor Seigal is surprised to see Sam walking towards him in Edgware High Street with a beautiful, sexy looking lady on his arm. She looks no more than 30. When they meet, doctor Seigal says, "It’s nice to see you Sam. When you have a moment, why don’t you call me? I have something I need to discuss with you."

"OK doctor," says Sam, "I’ll call you this afternoon."

When Sam rings later that day, doctor Seigal says to him, "I see that you’ve decided to start seeing other women, Sam."

"Yes doctor," replies Sam, "I’m doing what you suggested when you said ‘get a hot mamma and be cheerful.’"

"But that’s not what I said, Sam," says doctor Seigal, "I told you that ‘you've got a heart murmur... be careful.’"

### #1119 A night out

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Issy decides to go out for the evening. He might be nearly 90 years of age but Issy still thinks of himself as one of God’s gifts to the ladies. He gets himself ready in the usual manner and then looks at himself in the mirror. What does he see? He sees a handsome, mature, smartly dressed gentleman in a great looking modern suit, a carnation in his lapel, well groomed hair and sparkling eyes. Issy is pleased with what he sees. He finishes by spraying on his favourite Eau Savage cologne and then makes his way to the Park Lane Hilton.

Seated at the Hilton bar is Becky, in her mid eighties. Issy walks over, sits besides her, and orders a drink. When it arrives, he takes a sip, turns to Becky and says, "So tell me, do I come here often?"

### #1120 The blind date

[My thanks to Stan for the following]

Yitzhak is on his way to pick up his blind date. Little does he know that he has been paired up with Estelle, who, if truth be told, is definitely not one of the world’s good looking women - in fact quite the opposite.

Yitzhak picks her up as arranged outside Kings Cross station and as soon as she gets into his car, he knows he has made a big mistake. He is so embarrassed to have Estelle in his car with him and so afraid that one of his friends might see them together and think he’s gone blind, that he drives to a dark desolate spot by the Thames and turns off the engine.

Unfortunately, Estelle jumps to the wrong conclusion. She thinks Yitzhak wants to make love to her. So she begins to talk dirty and use all her sexual wiles to try and get Yitzhak in a ravenous mood for sex. But he just sits staring out of the window, wishing time would fly.

Finally, after half an hour of trying, and boy, how she talked and talked, Estelle asks him, "Don't you want it"?

And Yitzhak replies, "I feel like I already had it."

Maurice wakes up with a terrible pain in his mouth and books an emergency appointment to see Adrian, his dentist. When Maurice gets into the chair, Adrian checks his teeth and says, "You’ve got a badly decayed molar which really needs to be extracted right away. Are you OK with injections?"

"No, I'm afraid of needles," replies Maurice.

"How about gas?" asks Adrian.

"No, I'm allergic to gas. I come out in a terrible rash," replies Maurice.

Adrian then says, "I have an idea. Wait here while I get something."

When he returns, Adrian gives Maurice a glass of water and two blue pills.

"What kind of pills are these?" Maurice asks.

"They’re just ordinary Viagra pills," replies Adrian.

"What? Will these deaden the pain?"

"No," replies Adrian, "they won't help your pain at all, but they will give you something to hold onto whilst I extract your tooth."

### #1128 The singer

Leah walks into a pet shop in Golders Green and says to Hymie, the owner, "I want to buy a canary."

"We have many types," says Hymie, "is there any particular one you’re after?"

"Yes," replies Leah, "its got to be a very good singer. I'm prepared to pay good gelt (money) for a great singing bird."

"Lady, I’ve got the very one," says Hymie, "I’ve been in this business for a long time and this bird has the best singing voice I’ve ever heard. We don’t call it ‘Pavarotti’ for nothing. I’ll get it for you."

As he begins to climb a ladder to reach a small cage on the top shelf, Leah says, "I hope you’re not wasting your time. Just because you're climbing a ladder like a monkey won’t make me feel obliged to buy this canary if it’s not a real singing canary."

Hymie brings down the cage, places it on the shop counter and says to Leah, "Just you listen."

With that, the bird begins singing one beautiful song after another. Pleasantly surprised, Leah murmurs, "What mazel (luck) - this canary really can sing."

But then, a few seconds later, Leah shouts out, "Oy Vay, this canary’s only got one leg. Are you trying to cheat me, or what?"

Hymie calmly looks at Leah and replies, "Lady, do you want a singer or a dancer?"

Sharon is driving her 6year old daughter Emma to her friend’s house for tea. On the way, Emma asks, "How old are you, mummy?"

"Why darling," says Sharon, "you’re not supposed to ask a woman her age. It’s not polite."

"OK," says Emma, "how much do you weigh, mummy?"

"Really, Emma," says Sharon, "that’s a very personal question."

Emma carries on, "Why did you and daddy get divorced, mummy?"

"OK, that’s enough questions for today darling. Anyway, we’re here now. Lets take you inside."

Later, Emma and her friend are playing upstairs whilst their mothers are finishing tea.

"My mummy won’t tell me anything about her," Emma says to her friend.

"All you need do," says her friend, "is look at your mum’s driver’s license. It’s just like a report card, it has everything you need to know about her on it."

Later, soon after they return home, Emma says, "I know how old you are, mummy, you’re 30."

"I know everything, mummy," says Emma, "I even know why you and daddy got divorced."

Rabbi Bloom and Rabbi Levy look at each other with twinkles in their eyes. Without saying a word, they shrug their shoulders, exchange their homemade sandwiches and carry on eating.

### #1136 Music wins the day

Lionel is a well-educated bachelor who feels ready to marry and settle down. But he’s shy and finds it difficult to meet women. So he’s developed a great love of classical music and spends much of his spare time going to concerts.

Meanwhile, Lionel’s parents have been searching for a suitable shiddach (arranged marriage partner) for him. Then one day, to their great relief, two potential candidates come onto the scene at the same time (just like London buses). After talking to the two young ladies, his father has a word with Lionel.

"Lionel, I think I may have found you a wife. I have been in touch with two very acceptable, but quite different girls for you to choose from and both say they are ready to marry. Let me show you their photos."

The first photo is of a beautiful woman. "Rebecca," says his father, "informs me that she has a talent for cooking great kosher food – her matzo-ball soup is supposed to be superb. She also keeps fit with aerobics and Israeli dancing. But she left school at 15 and admits to having no talent whatsoever for music."

He then shows Lionel a photo of an ugly woman. She has what looks like a moustache on her top lip, her neck is as thick as a wrestler’s neck, she has cross-eyes, her nose is crooked and her lips are almost non-existent.

"Now Sadie," says his father, "might not be great looking but she comes from a fine, noble family, has a first class degree from Oxford University and has a wonderful operatic voice. She’ll be famous one day - she showed me a Poster of a concert she’s giving soon at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden."

Lionel studies the two photos. Although Rebecca is gorgeous, his keen love of music wins him over and he chooses Sadie. Within weeks, they marry.

On the first morning of their honeymoon, Lionel awakes before Sadie. He takes one look at that face staring up at him from their pillow, shakes Sadie and cries out, "Sadie, for goodness sake, sing a little something."

### #1137 The synagogue service

Max has been a confirmed atheist ever since he left University. But now that he is approaching his 60th birthday, spiritual issues start to become part of his life and he decides to ‘become’ a Jew again. The next shabbes, Max goes to shul for the first time in nearly 40 years.

He enjoys the occasion and even listens attentively to the Rabbi’s sermon, especially the bit at the end when the Rabbi announces that his sermon next week would be about the great flood.

At the end of the service, Max goes over to the Rabbi and says, "Rabbi, I really enjoyed the service. Unfortunately I won’t be able to attend next week. But please don’t think I will be shirking my duties – I can be as charitable as the next man. So please put me down for £20 for the flood victims."

### #1138 The 3 sons

Issy leaves school and decides to open a small grocery store in Hendon. He’s good to his customers and the store does well. Soon he meets a beautiful girl and within months they are married. A year later a boy arrives. Issy calls Dr Myers, a mohel, who performs the Bris and charges Issy £50.

Over the next 12 months, his business begins to take off and Issy opens a large supermarket in Hampstead. It too does well and they buy a nice house near their business. Then a second boy arrives and once again Issy calls Dr Myers who performs the Bris and who this time charges him £250.

Over the next two years, Issy opens more supermarkets and even moves into the catering business. They move home again, this time to a large 8-bedroom house in Knightsbridge. Then, once again, his wife presents him with a son and once again Issy requests the services of Dr Myers who performs the Bris. This time, Dr Myers charges Issy £1,000.

As Issy hands over the cheque, he says to Dr Myers, "Over the time we’ve been using you, your charges have increased by far more than inflation. Why should this be so? Is it because I’m wealthy?"

Dr Myers replies, "No, absolutely not. My £50 charge was for a Bris, my £250 charge was for a ritual circumcision and my £1,000 charge was for an extra special shmuckelotomy."

"Why thank you very much sir," says the beggar, "you are very generous."

"Tell me," asks Moshe, "don’t you have a family?"

"Oh yes," replies the beggar, "I have a lovely family."

"Do you have any children?" asks Moshe.

"I have two handsome boys and two beautiful girls," replies the beggar, "and all four are very happily married."

"Well I think it’s disgraceful that they won’t support you," says Moshe.

"But they would support me if I let them," says the beggar.

"So why don’t you let them?" asks Moshe.

"What, and lose my hard won independence?" replies the beggar.

### #1141 The home help

Naomi was happily married with two lovely boys. When she gave birth for the third time, her mother came over to stay with the family to help out. The two boys were excited that their bubbeh was coming - they always got on well with her.

The first thing bubbeh did was to go out and buy some of her own favourite cleaning materials so that, throughout her stay, Naomi’s house would be spotless. Bubbeh scrubbed the kitchen, bathrooms and toilets, vacuumed the carpets and polished the silver. Soon, the smell of bubbeh’s cleansers, polishes and air fresheners was everywhere.

After two months, bubbeh went back to her own house, her job done. A few days later, Naomi used one of bubbeh’s cleansers to remove a greasy mark from her kitchen worktop. She had just put away the cleanser when her youngest son came into the kitchen and said, "Where's bubbeh, mummy?"

"She’s back at her own house now," said Naomi, "don't you remember we took her to the station?"

"Then why do I smell her perfume?" he asked.

### #1142 Bible marketing

Abe is in New York on business. On his 3rd night, he goes back to his hotel room feeling quite miserable. Although the trip’s going well, business-wise, he’s feeling very lonely - he’s missing his wife Sarah.

He casually picks up the Gideon bible from his bedside table and opens it. On the first page, he reads: -

"If you’re sick, read Psalm 18."

"If you’re troubled, read Psalm 45."

"If you’re lonely, read Psalm 92."

"If you’re ………"

That’s it! He stops there, immediately turns to Psalm 92 and starts to read. How surprised he is, then, when he gets to the end of the Psalm, to see someone has written: -

"If you’re still lonely, why don’t you call Fifi on 202-123-1234."

His father couldn’t understand why his son should give up a good job to become a policeman. So at the end of Joshua’s first week, he rang Joshua to ask how he liked his new job.

"Well dad," Joshua replied, "It’s nice of you to ask. The salary is just about OK, the hours aren't as bad as I thought they would be and my colleagues are a great bunch. But what I like best is that the customer is always wrong."

"I can't go through with my marriage," he answered, "I feel so sick that my stomach is cramping up all the time. My legs are like rubber bands and I can hardly walk in a straight line. I don’t know whether I’m coming or going, Rabbi."

Rabbi Bloom smiled, "Don’t worry, Aaron, yours are common symptoms. I get to see them quite regularly. You’ve got PMS."

"I’ve got PMS?" said Aaron, puzzled.

"Yes," said Rabbi Bloom, "You’ve got a dose of Pre-Marriage Syndrome."

He has just performed a circumcision on an elderly man and although it went well he is worried that one day it just might happen that things could really go wrong. He now thinks he should take out some professional insurance and calls Monty, who is an insurance broker.

"Monty," says Emanuel, "I need some malpractice cover designed for mohels."

"This I've never heard before," says Monty, "but give me a day to investigate."

Next day, Monty calls back, "Do you want the good news or the bad news?"

"So give me the good news first," says Emanuel.

"No regular insurance company will offer you such insurance. But Lloyds of London will insure you for up to £1M at a premium of £500 per year."

"Nu, and the bad news?" asks Emanuel.

"There's a two inch deductible."

Maurice is in hospital and knows he is dying. As he lays in bed in his private room, struggling to breathe, his family and children around him, he starts to talk very quietly.

"Freda," he whispers.

"Yes dear, what is it?" Freda says.

"I want you should know something before I die. Harry the butcher owes me £100, Levine the pharmacist owes me £400, and our next door neighbour Moishe owes me £600 and the return of my lawnmower. Don’t let them off, will you?"

"Of course I won’t, darling," Freda replies.

Freda turns to her children and says, "Oy, what a wonderful man your father is. Let this be a lesson to you all - even though he’s dying, he still knows who owes him money. What a mensh he is."

Then Maurice then finds some strength to say a bit more. "Freda, I want you also to know that I still owe Bernard, my cousin, £1,700 of the £5,000 he lent me 3 years ago."

"Oy veh," cries Freda, "it’s nearly the end for my Maurice – he’s getting delirious."

[My thanks to Ian O for the following]

It’s Yom Kippur and Aaron is in synagogue, but he’s not feeling too good. So during a short break after the Rabbi’s sermon, he goes over to the Rabbi.

"I really need your help, Rabbi Levy."

"Yes, Aaron, how can I help," says the Rabbi.

"I obviously know that I’m meant to fast today, but I’m so, so thirsty. Please, Rabbi, can I have something to drink?"

Rabbi Levy replies in a firm voice, "I’m sorry, Aaron, but you know the rules - it has to be a life-threatening situation before I can allow you to break the fast."

"But Rabbi, it is serious," says Aaron, "if I don't get something to drink, I’ll faint from thirst. Really I will."

After much to-ing and fro-ing, Rabbi Levy relents and instructs the Gabbai to give Aaron a small glass of water kept just for such emergencies. As soon as Aaron has drunk the water, he says, "Thank you Rabbi, I promise you that it will be the last time I'll eat salt herring for breakfast on Yom Kippur."

"Who is your father?"

"The Soviet Union."

"Who is your mother?"

"The communist party."

"And what do you want to be when you grow up?"

Haim replies, "An orphan."

### #1158 The watch tower

In the middle of a forest is a small town. It was built far from the main roads and the Jews living there were afraid that when the Messiah comes, he would not know they were there and would pass them by. So they build a tower on the edge of town and appoint the town beggar as watchman. If the Messiah should come, the watchman would give him directions to the town.

One day a stranger visits the tower and as instructed, the watchman comes down to greet him.

"What are you doing here in the middle of nowhere?" asks the stranger.

"My job is to sit on top of this tower and wait for the Messiah," answers the watchman.

"So how do you like your job?" the stranger asks, "it can’t pay you much."

Sadie was in her garden hanging up her washing when Sharon, her next door neighbour, poked her head over the fence and said, "I don’t like being the one to have to tell you this Sadie, but there's a rumour going around that your husband Cyril is chasing the shiksas."

"So what?" said Sadie.

"But at his age!" said Sharon, "He's over 70 isn’t he?"

### #1165 The stock market

One day, little Benny asks his father Harry question, "Dad, what is the Stock Market?"

"Benny," replies Harry, "you’re too young to understand. Later."

"I am not that young," says Benny, "I want to know now."

"Please, wait a few years, then you will understand better."

"Dad, I don't want to start life poor, like you did, selling second-hand furniture. That’s why I want to know now"

"Alright, already," said Harry, "It's like this.  You buy two chickens and the two chickens lay eggs.  So, next year, you have thirty chickens.  These thirty chickens then all lay eggs and these eggs turn into chickens.  So you end up having thousands of chickens and you’re well off.  You see, this is the stock market. You understand, Benny?"

"Yes, Dad."

"And then, one day, the sky opens up and it rains. It rains like in the days of Noah. The floods come and they wash away all the chickens until they drown and you then have only two or three chickens left. You see, this is the stock market - you should have bought ducks."

The police are called to Avrahom’s house in Hampstead Garden Suburb - the neighbours have heard some screaming. When the police arrive, they find Avrahom’s wife Sadie standing over Avrahom’s lifeless body holding a 6-iron in her hand. The club is still dripping blood.

A police constable asks Sadie, "Is that your husband, madam?"

"Yes it is," replies Sadie.

"And did you hit him with that golf club you’re holding, madam?"

"Certainly," replies Sadie. She then drops the golf club, puts her hands over her face and begins to cry. "We only just got back from playing at a golf tournament," she sobs.

"How many times did you hit your husband, madam?" asks the constable.

Shlomo goes to see his psychiatrist. "Doctor, my wife Fay is being unfaithful to me. Every night, she goes to Palwin’s Wine Bar and picks up a man. She sleeps with anybody who asks her to. I'm going crazy with worry. What on earth should I do?"

### #1176 Kreplachaphobia

Miriam had a problem with her young son Ben - he went into a total panic every time she served up the family’s favourite dish of kreplach.  Every effort she and her husband made to explain to Ben how nice kreplach tasted failed miserably. So she took Ben to see doctor Lewis, an eminent psychiatrist.

Doctor Lewis listened to the problem, then said, "I think this situation is easy to resolve. All you have done so far is talk – you’ve told Ben how nice kreplach are but you haven’t yet shown him how nice they are. So take him home and let him watch you prepare the kreplach. First of all, let him see the ingredients that go inside a kreplach. Then show him how a kreplach is made. Once he sees there’s nothing to be scared of, he will grow to like them."

When they returned home, Miriam followed doctor Lewis’s advice. She took Ben into her kitchen and sat him down to watch her prepare a kreplach. She put in front of him a small mound of dough and a plate of chopped meat she had prepared earlier. "See Ben," she said, "is there anything here to be worried about?"

"No mum," smiled Ben.

Miriam then put some minced meat in the centre of the dough and folded over one corner. She looked at Ben and saw he was still smiling. ‘Maybe this will actually work,’ she thought.

She folded over the second corner (Ben was still smiling) and then the third. All was going better than she had dared hope. Then she folded over the last corner – and immediately Ben started to get into a state and shouted, "Oy veh, kreplach."

### #1180 Keep your eyes open

One day, Moshe is walking past the wooden fence at the side of the local Mental Care Home for Jewish People when he hears the residents inside chanting, "Thirteen! Thirteen! Thirteen!"

Moshe is quite a curious kind of man and wonders, "Is there a barmitzvah or batmitzvah going on inside?" So he searches for a suitable hole in the fence and then he looks in. Immediately, someone inside the fence pokes him in the eye with their finger.

Then the chanting begins again, "Fourteen! Fourteen! Fourteen!"

### #1183 Easier said than done

Moshe goes to Heathrow Airport to fly to New York. While he is waiting for his flight, he notices a lady sitting nearby crying. So he goes over and asks her if anything was wrong.

She says, "My son John moved to New York some months ago and I haven't heard from him since. I’m so worried. Even though we’re Jewish, he’s never called or written to me. So I come here from time to time because he left from this airport and I feel closer to him here than anywhere else."

As they talk, the lady asks, "Would you by any chance be going to New York?"

Moshe replies, "Well, as a matter of fact I am."

She says, "Oh would you please find my son and ask him to call me? His name is John Dun, spelled with one N."

Moshe replies, "I don't think it’s possible to find one man in New York."

She says, "Oh, please try. It would mean so much to me. I miss him so very much."

After much pleading, Moshe finally agrees to do his best.

All the way to New York, he wonders, "How can I ever find her son?" When the plane lands, he takes a cab to his hotel. As the cab nears his hotel, Moshe sees on the side of one of the sky scrapers ‘DUN AND BRADSTREET’ so he says to himself, "This might be easier than I thought."

Later that day, after unpacking, he goes into the D&B building, walks up to the receptionist and asks, "Do you have a John here?"

She replies, "Yes. Down this hall to the right and it’s the third door on the left."

He thanks her and goes looking for the door she pointed out. He finds it and goes in. Just as he walks into the room, there is a man there, drying his hands. Moshe says to him, "Are you Dun?"

The man replies, "Yes."

Moshe says, "Call your mother."

### #1184 Don’t be so cheap

A man dies and his 3 best friends, Shlomo, Patrick and Peter are looking at his body in the coffin.

Patrick says, "He was such a good friend to me that I don’t want him to go to his maker empty handed." He then throws £200 in £20 notes into the coffin.

Peter says, "I agree, so I'll match that," and he also throws £200 in notes into the coffin.

Shlomo says, "What cheap-skates you both are. I’m ashamed to know you. I'm going to give him £1,000."

Shlomo then writes out a cheque for £1,400, throws it in and takes the £400 in change out of the coffin.

### #1185 Visit to a hotel

Sadie was a very successful businesswoman and loved all the nice things in life money brought her. One day, she decided that she and her husband Moshe would spend a week’s holiday at the Gelt Plaza, a 6-star hotel in Bournmouth and she decided to drive there in her new top-of-the range Aston Martin saloon.

2 hours later, she was pleased to see the looks of awe on the faces of the staff as she pulled up outside the hotel’s front door. Three porters went up to greet her as she stepped out of the car. She immediately said to one of them, in a commanding voice, “Carry my luggage into the hotel, my good man.”  Then she said to the two other porters, “And could you two please carry my husband into the hotel.”

They were surprised by this request but nevertheless did what was asked, carried Moshe into the lobby and placed him in an armchair by reception.

Then the hotel manager, who had seen all of this, came over to Sadie and said, “Mrs Bloom, welcome to our hotel. I’m sorry to see that your husband is too ill even to walk.”

“What do you mean he can’t walk?” replied Sadie. “Of course he can walk. But thank God I’m now wealthy enough where my Moshe doesn't have to walk.”

"A cheque," replies the official.

### #1188 Reconciliation

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Abe was very fussy with his money and always, regular as clockwork, went through his wife Sadie’s chequebook each month to see where their money was going. He always wanted to see everything balance to the exact penny. This month, as in previous months, Sadie’s figures are hard to reconcile and tired of having to spend so much time on her inaccuracies, Abe makes her agree to spend some time putting her figures into shape before he devotes any more time on them.

After spending hours poring over her paperwork, Sadie looks up and says, "Well, Abe, you should be proud of me. I've done it – I’ve made it balance."

So Abe goes over to take a look. "OK, let's see what you’ve done."

On her worksheet he sees a long list of items starting with Mortgage £1,550.00; Electricity £70.50; Gas £150.75; Telephones £350.22; Private Medical Insurance £5,900.50; Kosher butcher £350.99; and ending with ESP £109.01. Puzzled by the last entry, Abe says, "What on earth is ESP, Sadie?"

"That’s easy," replies Sadie, "It stands for, Error Some Place!"

"It all depends," replies Hannah. "What does it say on your sweatshirt?"

"Yeshiva University," he replies.

### #1192 The rabbi and the bear

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Rabbi Bloom from London is visiting two friends in America. One is a priest and the other a Pentecostal preacher. As soon as they meet up, they start to talk shop. Their discussion centres on whether preaching to people is really that hard. They quickly agree that a real challenge would be to preach to a bear and they decide to experiment. Each would go into the woods, find a bear and preach to it.

A week later, they're all together to discuss the experience. Father Carroll, who has his arm in a sling and is on crutches, speaks first. "Well," he says, "I went into the woods, found a bear and began to read to him from the Baltimore Catechism. Unfortunately, the bear wanted nothing to do with me and begun to slap me about. I quickly grabbed my holy water and, the saints be praised, he became very subdued. My bishop is coming out next week to give him his first communion and confirmation."

Reverend Billy Bob speaks next. He is in a wheelchair, with an arm and both legs in casts. "Well, brothers, you know that we don't sprinkle – we dunk. I found a bear and began to read to him from God's Holy Word. But that bear wanted nothing to do with me. So I took hold of him and we began to wrestle. Up and down the hills we wrestled until we come to a creek where I quickly dunked and baptised him. He immediately became very subdued and we spent three days in fellowship, praising God's Holy word."

They both then look down at Rabbi Bloom who is lying in a hospital bed, is wearing a full body cast, is in traction and has IVs and monitors running in and out of his torn body. Rabbi Bloom looks up at his two friends and says, "When I found a bear, I found preaching to him very easy. But Oy Vay, did he get touchy about the circumcision!"

[My thanks to Ian and Jackie for the following]

Abe was due a visit from the Inland Revenue inspector to go through some discrepancies in his accounts. Should he dress up or down for the meeting? He just didn’t know what was best so he asked both his accountant and his lawyer for their views.

His accountant told him, "Wear your worst clothes, shmattas even, and an old pair of shoes. Make him believe you’re very poor."

But his lawyer told him, "Wear your smartest suit with a good shirt, expensive tie and nice cuff-links. That way you won’t be intimidated."

Abe was confused and went to see his Rabbi about the conflicting advice he had been given. "Let me answer your dilemma with a story," said the Rabbi.

A woman, about to marry, asked her mother what she should wear on her wedding night. Her mother replied, "Put on a long nightgown that goes right up to your neck and wear woollen socks."

But when the woman asked her best friend, she got conflicting advice. "Put on your sexiest, most see-through negligee."

"I don’t understand, Rabbi. What does this have to do with my interview with the Inland Revenue?" asked Abe.

"It means that it doesn't matter what you wear," replied the Rabbi, "you're going to get screwed anyway."

### #1208 The Dior dress

One day, just as Rebecca was walking past ‘Yiddishe Mumma Exclusive Fashions’ in Golders Green, she saw them putting a new dress in their window. It stopped her in her tracks – it was a pale green Dior evening dress and she was totally entranced by this brilliant creation. She was convinced that it was bashayrt (destined by fate) – it was meant for her.  But it was priced at £3,500 and she had to think of a good way to persuade her Hymie to buy it for her. Then she had an idea. She couldn’t wait to get home.

"Hymie, darling?"

"Yes, what is it Rebecca?"

"Last night I had a lovely dream, Hymie," she said.

"So what kind of a dream was it, Rebecca?" he asked.

"I dreamed that we passed by Yiddishe Mumma, and in the window was this gorgeous Dior dress at only £3,500. And do you know what you did, Hymie?"

"Nu, so what did I do?" he asked.

"You went into the shop and bought it for me, darling."

"Did I really?" Hymie said, "That really was a wonderful dream. Please God, in all your future dreams, you should wear it in good health."

### #1210 Follow my leader

Little Emma is watching her mother preparing their Shabbat dinner – this week it’s Salt Beef. Emma watches her mother slice off both ends of the joint and place it in a saucepan ready for cooking. So Emma asks, "Why did you cut both ends off, Mum?"

Her mother pauses for a few seconds, then replies, "That’s a good question, Emma. It’s what my mother always did when she made Salt Beef and I just do the same. But I’ve no idea why. Let’s phone bubbeh and ask her."

So they phone bubbeh and ask why she always sliced the ends off the Salt Beef before cooking.

Bubbeh replies, "You know, I'm not sure why – that was the way I always saw my mother make Salt Beef."

Because they are now very curious, they visit Emma’s great grandmother in the nursing home and say to her, "You know when we make Salt Beef, why do we always slice off the ends before cooking it?"

"I don't know why you do it," says the great grandmother, "but I never had a saucepan that was large enough!"

"I know," replies his boss, "last week I overpaid you £100 and you said nothing."

Embarrassed, Shlomo says, "Well, I don't mind an occasional mistake. But when it gets to be a habit, I feel I have to call it to your attention."

### #1213 In return

On the first day God created Cow. And God said to the cow, "I would like you to go into the field with the farmer and suffer in the sun all day long, have calves and give milk to the farmer to help him survive. In return I will give you a life of 60years."

Cow said, "That's a hard life you’ve mapped out for me, especially as you want me to live for 60years. Instead, just give me 20years and I'll give back the other 40."

And God agreed.

On the second day God created Dog. And God said to the dog, "I would like you to sit all day outside the front door of your house and bark at everyone who comes in or walks near you. In return, I will give you a life of 20years."

Dog said, "That's going to be hard work barking all day, especially as you want me to be doing this for 20years. Instead, just give me 10years and I'll give back the other 10."

And God agreed.

On the third day God created Monkey. And God said to the monkey, "I would like you to entertain people by doing lots of monkey tricks and making them laugh. In return, I'll give you a life of 20years."

Monkey said, "That’s a very boring life you want to give me, doing monkey tricks for 20years. I’d rather not, if you don’t mind.  I hear that Dog gave you back 10years so I’d like to do the same. Is that OK?"

And God agreed.

On the fourth day God created Man. And God said to the man, "Just for you, I would like you to eat, sleep, play and enjoy. You’ll need do nothing else - just enjoy, enjoy. And in return, I will give you a life of 20years."

Man said, "What, only 20years? That’s not enough. Let me make a suggestion. I'll take my 20years plus the 40years Cow returned plus the 10years Monkey returned plus the 10years Dog returned. I make that ….. 80years. Can I have 80years, please?"

"Okay," said God, "I agree."

That’s why: -

for the first 20years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy and do nothing,

for the next 40years we slave in the sun to support our family,

for the next 10years we do monkey tricks to entertain our grandchildren,

and for the last 10years we sit in front of the house and bark at everybody.

Victor, Cyril and Abe met up in Brent Cross shopping centre for a chat and a coffee. Victor says, "Do you two know that last night I made love to mine Leah three times and this morning, as soon as I awoke, she told me how much she loved me."

"Mazeltov," says Cyril, "but last night I made love to mine Sarah four times and this morning, as soon as I awoke, she told me I must be the world’s greatest lover."

Abe doesn’t say a word and just takes another sip of his coffee. So his two friends ask him how many times he had made love last night.

"Vell if you must know," replies Abe, "I made love to mine Becky vonce."

"Only once?" says Cyril, "And what did Becky say to you this morning?"

"She said, ‘Don’t stop!’"

### #1220 A surprise restaurant visit

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Rabbi Levy is walking home from shul one shabbes when he sees Issy in front of him. Issy is a learned and respected man who can hold his own with the rabbi on tulmudic discussions. As Rabbi Levy tries to catch up with Issy, he is shocked to see him go into ‘The Chinese Crab’ restaurant. As he looks through the window, Rabbi Levy sees Issy giving his order to a waiter and a short time later sees the food arrive – a plate of shrimps, lobsters and crabs. As Issy picks up the chopsticks and starts to eat, Rabbi Levy bursts into the restaurant and confronts Issy.

"Issy, just what do you think you are doing coming into this restaurant and ordering this treif (non kosher food)? You are not only violating everything we are taught about the dietary laws, but you also seem to be enjoying this food."

"Rabbi," says Issy, "did you see me enter this establishment?"

"Yes."

"And did you see me order this food?"

"Yes."

"And did you see the waiter bring the food to me?"

"Yes."

"And did you then see me eat the food?"

"Yes."

"Then I don't see a problem, rabbi. Everything was done under full Rabbinical Supervision."

### #1223 Let’s go

The regulations at Golders Green Hospital require a wheelchair to be provided for all patients being discharged. So when Michelle, a student nurse, was told that the patient in Room 50 was being discharged, she found a wheelchair and took it to the room. When she entered, there was Moshe, an elderly man, fully dressed and sitting on the bed with a suitcase at his feet. "OK, lets go," she told him, "just pop into the wheelchair and I’ll take you downstairs."

Moshe argued with her. "But I don’t need your help to go downstairs, nurse. I’m not that old. I can do it perfectly well by myself."

But no matter how hard he insisted that he didn't need her help to leave the hospital, Michelle was more insistent. "You just have to leave in the wheelchair, no matter how fit you think you are – it’s the rules," she said, "You can’t change them."

So very reluctantly, Moshe let Michelle wheel him to the lift. On their way down, Michelle asked him if his wife was meeting him.

"I don't know," Moshe said, "she's still upstairs in the bathroom changing out of her hospital gown."

### #1224 Age matters

Avrahom is a lively 75 year old widower. He is also very rich. One day, he turns up at the Kosher K restaurant in Hendon to meet some of his friends and he has a gorgeous young redhead on his arm. She has sex appeal in plenty and listens to Avrahom’s every word with great attention. All his friends think she is as sexy a lady as they have seen for years.

When she excuses herself to go to the ladies, Avrahom’s friends rush over to him. "Avrahom, how did you manage to get such a lovely girlfriend?" they ask.

"Girlfriend?" says Avrahom looking upset, "what do you mean girlfriend? Naomi is my wife."

They were shocked. "So how did you persuade Naomi to marry you?"

"I lied about my age," Avrahom replies.

"Don’t tell us that you told Naomi that you were only 50?"

"Of course not," smiles Avrahom, "I told her I was 90."

### #1225 The 2 questions

[My thanks to Ian for the following]

Rabbi Bloom gets on a tube train on its way to Golders Green. As soon as the doors close, a priest gets up, goes over to the rabbi and says, "Good morning rabbi. I have a question to ask you. Why is it that everybody thinks Jews are smarter than Gentiles?"

Rabbi Bloom, who is not up for an argument, says, "I’m sorry, but I am just a simple rabbi and I’m not really able to participate in such a discussion."

But the priest insists. "Look, no harm meant rabbi, but I have a theory and I need to test it out in the form of a bet. I’ll pay you £100 if you can ask me a question that I can't answer. But if I can ask you a question that you can't answer, you must pay me £100."

Rabbi Bloom replies, "But I’m a poor rabbi - I only have £10 on me."

The priest hesitates then says, "OK, rabbi, it’s my £100 against your £10."

Rabbi Bloom realises he can't get out of this so he agrees, but on condition that he asks the first question. The priest agrees.

"OK," says Rabbi Bloom, "what animal has scaly skin, the body of a cat, the face of a squirrel, the ears of a mouse, webbed toes and swims under water?"

Surprised, the priest admits that he doesn't know and asks the rabbi for a few more minutes to think about it. The rabbi agrees.

2 minutes later, the priest takes £100 from his wallet and gives it to the rabbi. The priest then asks the rabbi, "So what animal was it?"

Rabbi Bloom replies, "How should I know?" and gives the priest £10.

### #1226 The advert

[My thanks to Malcolm for the following]

Bernie has been ill for some months and then suddenly dies. As is the custom, his wife Sadie puts an advert in the ‘deaths’ section of the Jewish Chronicle, but this advert is slightly unusual – it states that Bernie died of gonorrhoea. Immediately, a close friend of Bernie rings Sadie to complain.

"Sadie," he says, "you know full well that Bernie died of diarrhoea, not gonorrhoea. So why did you word the advert incorrectly?"

"I looked after Bernie day and night for over 3 months," replies Sadie, "so of course I know he died of diarrhoea. But I thought it would be best for people to remember Bernie as a great lover rather than the big sh*t he was."

### #1227 The cure

Faye goes to her doctors’ surgery and is seen by Dr Myers, a new young doctor who has just joined the practice. Within five minutes of talking to the doctor, Faye bursts out of his consulting room and runs crying out loudly down the hall. Fortunately, the receptionist is able to stop her and makes her take a seat. When Faye has calmed down, the receptionist asks, "Faye, what’s the matter? Tell me what’s happened."

After listening to her story, the receptionist says, "Wait her, Faye, I’ll sort this out for you here and now."

The receptionist strides purposely down the hall to Dr Myers room and enters. "Doctor, what's the matter with you? Mrs Cohen is nearly 60years old and has two grown up children and four grandchildren. Yet you just told her that she’s pregnant? How could you do such a thing?"

Dr Myers replies, without looking up from making his notes, "Nu? Does she still have the hiccups?"

### #1228 Appearances can be deceptive

It’s Friday and Moshe is in Shanghai on business. He asks the hotel’s concierge whether there’s a shul nearby. There is, so he gets instructions on how to get there and arrives just before the start of evening service.  Moshe is amazed. It’s the largest shul he’s ever seen and not only that, it’s packed with Chinese worshippers. He is lucky and finds the last available seat.

All through the service, Moshe notices the rabbi looking over to where he’s sitting and just before the service ends, the rabbi makes his way over to where Moshe is sitting.

"Where are you from?" the rabbi asks.

"I am from Golders Green in London," replies Moshe.

"Are you Jewish?" asks the rabbi.

Moshe replies, "But of course I am."

Then the rabbi says, "funny, you no rook Jewish."

### #1231 Heavenly needs

Rabbi Bloom was testing the children in his Sunday Hebrew class to see if they understood the concept of going to heaven. So he asked them, "Boys and girls, if I sold my house and my car and gave all the money to the shul, would that let me go to heaven?"

"No," the children shouted out.

"OK," said the rabbi, "if I cleaned the shul every day, washed all our stained glass windows, inside and out and kept every prayer book neat and tidy on the shelves, would that let me go to heaven?"

Again, the answer shouted out was, "No."

Rabbi Bloom was beginning to really enjoy this ‘test’.

"Well then children," he asked, "if I was the kindest person in the whole world to animals and if I gave pieces of halva and kosher sweets to every boy and girl in North London and if I promised never to shout at any of you, would that let me go to heaven?"

Again, all the children shouted out, "No."

"Well," Rabbi Bloom continued, "how then can I get to heaven?"

With that, Aaron, a six year old, shouted out, "You’ve got to be dead, rabbi."

### #1232 Shul goer

As Daniel and his wife Naomi are coming out of shul one shabbes, she says to him, "That Robson girl has put on a lot of weight, dear. Maybe she’s pregnant. What do you think?"

"The Robson girl? If she was there, I didn't see her," replies Daniel.

"And did you see that flirty Sharon Kay winking at the boys? Disgraceful, don’t you think, dear?"

"I must have been looking the other way when this happened," he replies.

"And what do you think about the short dress Rivkah Levy was wearing? That can’t be the right thing for a mother of three children to wear in shul. Don’t you agree, dear?" asks Naomi.

"Sorry darling," replies Daniel, "but I didn’t notice her dress."

"Well then, you must have seen Kitty Usum drinking all those glasses of wine during Kiddush," she says.

"I wasn't watching Kitty," says Daniel.

"Oh for goodness sake," shouts Naomi, "I don’t know why you bother to go to shul these days."

No one knows how it happened but once upon a time a female brain cell, by mistake, happened to end up in a man's head.  She looked around nervously, but all around her was empty and quiet.

"Hello?" she cried out, but she got no answer.

So she cried out a little louder, "Is there anyone here?" but still she got no answer.

Feeling very much alone and getting quite scared, she yelled out at the top of her voice, "Hello, hello, is there anyone here?"

Then, at last, she heard very faint voices from a long way away ......"Hello, we're all down here."

### #1235 The wrong one

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Naomi’s husband dies and all of a sudden she’s on her own to bring up Leah, her 10year old daughter. After some time has passed, she starts looking for a partner, not an easy task, but then Mr Shapiro comes onto the scene. He’s much older than Naomi but is wealthy and presentable, so Naomi accepts his invite for a meal at Bens Kosher Kitchen. They have a good time and start seeing each other on a regular basis. She likes him very much and is glad things are getting serious between them – after all, Leah could do with a new father figure around the house.

When it’s time to introduce Mr Shapiro to Leah, she decides to invite him over for a shabbes dinner. He accepts and at once Naomi begins to worry about the one thing that could ruin her chances of marriage - Mr Shapiro has a large wart on his nose. She is worried that Leah will not only stare at it but also laugh at it. No matter how hard she tries, she can’t get the scene out of her mind.

Friday arrives and she’s in such despair that she decides to tell Leah what’s troubling her. As they are setting the table, she says, "Please Leah, I want you be on your very best behaviour tonight and.….oh yes, one other thing, darling, don’t say a thing about the wart on Mr Shapiro’s nose. I don’t want him upset."

"OK, mum, I won’t mention it, I promise," says Leah.

In the event, the meal is a great success. Conversation flows easily and Leah behaves impeccably, not a word out of place. Naomi breathes a massive sigh of relief when Leah asks to be excused just before dessert. As Leah closes the door behind her, Naomi turns towards Mr Shapiro and asks, "So Mr Shapiro, would you like cream or custard on your wart?”

### #1236 Deja vu

[My thanks to Ian S for the following]

Abe is on holiday in Israel with his wife, children and mother-in-law. Sadly, while they are visiting Jerusalem, Abe's mother-in-law dies. Abe goes to the British Embassy with her death certificate in his hand to make arrangements to send her body back to the UK for burial. As soon as the Embassy official realises that it’s Abe’s mother-in-law who has died, he tells Abe that it’s very expensive to send a body back to the UK.

"It could cost as much as £2,000," he says, "so in most cases, the family decide to bury the body here in Israel because this only costs £100."

But Abe gets agitated, "I don't care how much it costs to send her body back to the UK, that's what I want to do. OK?"

"OK," says the official, "calm down. We’ll do it. You must have loved your mother-in-law a lot, considering the price difference."

"No, that’s not the reason," says Abe, "it’s just that I know of a case of someone who was buried here in Jerusalem many, many years ago and on the 3rd day he arose from the dead. I just don’t want to take that chance."

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Freda and Ethel, both in their eighties, are sitting on a bench outside Edgware town hall where they had just visited the annual flower show. Freda turns to Ethel and says, "Don’t you agree that life is getting more and more boring? We don’t seem to be able to have the fun we used to."

"I agree with you there," says Ethel.

"Do you know," continues Freda, "I’d love to take off all my clothes and run naked through the flower show. That would liven things up."

"I bet you £5 you wouldn’t dare," says Ethel.

"You're on!" says Freda and 2 minutes later, completely naked, she ‘streaks’ through the front door of the flower show.

As Ethel waits outside, she hears a commotion going on inside the town hall. Then Freda, still naked, runs back out, followed by a smiling, cheering crowd.

"What happened, Freda?" asks Ethel.

"I just won 1st prize for Best Dried Arrangement."

### #1240 Start with the easy solution

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Faye and Monty have been married for over 30 years when all of a sudden they decide to separate. It shocks friends and family alike.

Monty decides to become more ‘orthodox’ and starts to spend much time in the synagogue with Rabbi Bloom. Then, two years after they split, Monty and Faye decide to get back together.

Monty now wants Faye to join him in becoming more orthodox and asks that she does out the kitchen and make it ‘glatt kosher’. But Faye is not at all interested. Monty is very upset with her attitude and goes to see Rabbi Bloom.

"Rabbi," he asks, "what can I do? How can I get Faye to become more orthodox? For example, how can I get her to run a kosher kitchen?"

Rabbi Bloom strokes his beard and nods sympathetically. "Tell me, Monty, how many Jewish commandments are there in existence?"

Monty has recently learned this and quickly gives the correct answer, "613."

Rabbi Bloom replies, "so why don’t you start with ones that don't annoy her?"

Abe replies, "OK, but that will be another 25p."

"How come?" says the boy, "the sign clearly says ‘All you can drink for 25p."

"Nu?" says Abe, "you had a glass of lemonade, didn't you?"

"Yes."

"Well," says Abe, "that's all you can drink for 25p."

It is Friday and to his surprise, Max is told that he is being promoted to manager. He is also given the afternoon off. When he gets home to his 6th floor flat and tells his wife Helen the good news, they decide to celebrate by making love. But what are they going to do about their 9year old son Sam?

"I know," says Max, "let’s put Sam out onto the balcony and get him to report to us on everything he sees happening in the neighbourhood. That’ll keep him busy."

"Good idea, darling" says Helen and 10 minutes later, Sam begins his reporting at the same time she and Max begin their lovemaking.

"OK dad," reports Max, "they’re towing away Mr Shineman’s 4x4 from in front of his flat."

A few moments later, Max says, "A fire engine has just stopped outside the Himmelfarb’s shop."

Then he shouts out, "Looks like the Levy’s are going to the synagogue."

Followed quickly by, "My friend David’s riding his new red 2 wheeler bike across the main road."

And then, "Mr and Mrs Abrahams are having sex."

At that, Max and Helen sit up in bed and shout out, "How do you know that, Sam?"

### #1249 Naomi’s turn

[My thanks to Anna R for the following]

It started when Faye and Naomi were friends at school. Faye seemed to spend her entire time trying to get one over on Naomi and never missed an opportunity to belittle her. Whatever Naomi had or did, Faye would better it.

Then they left school to go their own ways. 30 years later, by chance, Faye and Naomi meet again at Brent Cross shopping centre. And guess what?  Nothing has changed. Within minutes, Faye is boasting about her life and whenever Naomi says something, Faye dismisses it with contempt. After fifteen minutes of this, Faye looks at her watch and says, "I must go pick up my diamonds. My husband Lou is so wealthy that once a month he sends them to Hatton Garden for cleaning. We’re going to the Royal Opera tonight, it’s Madama Butterfly, and we have the best seats. So I need my diamonds."

"Oh," replies Naomi with a smile on her face, "do you clean your diamonds? My husband David is so rich that he throws my diamonds away when they get dirty and buys me new ones."'

### #1250 Shipwrecked

At the end of a hard year’s work, Moshe decides to take a holiday right away and he books himself on a Caribbean cruise.  The first few days of the cruise are perfect but then calamity - the ship sinks and Moshe ends up on a small, uncharted island. He looks around and sees that there is nothing nearby except bananas and coconuts. Still, these are better than starving to death.

Ten weeks later, as he is sitting in the shade, to his surprise a small boat lands on the beach and the most beautiful woman he has ever seen gets out,  walks over to him and says, "Hi."

He can’t believe his luck. He replies, "Hi to you too. Where on earth have you come from? How did you get here? What’s your name?"

"Hold on," she says, "one question at a time. I landed on the other side of this island about 10 weeks ago when my cruise liner sank. I’ve just rowed here from the other side. Oh, and my name is Hannah."

"That’s amazing, Hannah," he says. "My name is Moshe. You were lucky to have a rowboat wash up with you."

"Oh, this?" replies Hannah, "I made it myself out of raw materials I found on the island. The oars are made from pine tree branches, I wove the bottom from palm branches and the sides came from a Eucalyptus tree."

"But where did you get the tools from?" he asks.

"Oh, I made the tools myself," replies Hannah. "I found an unusual strata of exposed alluvial rock which I heated in my kiln. It melted into a soft iron-like material which I used to make the tools which in turn I used to make the boat."

Moshe is silent. He can’t believe her skills.

"If it’s OK with you, why don’t I now row you to my place?" she says.

Moshe just nods his acceptance.

It takes Hannah just ten minutes to row to her placed. As they near the shore, Moshe is surprised to see a stone walkway leading up to a very smart sky blue bungalow. Hannah ties up her boat at a small jetty using a hand made flaxen rope, and they enter the bungalow.

"It's not really much," says Hannah, "but to me, Moshe, it’s home. Please sit down and I’ll get you a drink."

"No thanks," Moshe replies, "I just couldn’t drink any more coconut juice."

"But you don’t have to have coconut juice," says Hannah, "How about a Pina Colada? I’ve made a still."

As they sit down on her hand made couch drinking their Pina Coladas, Moshe looks around and is amazed at what Hannah has achieved in such a short time. After a while, Hannah gets up and says, "I’m going to slip into something more comfortable. While you’re waiting, why don’t you take a shower and then have a shave? You’ll find a razor in the bathroom cabinet."

Moshe goes into the bathroom and runs his bath. It even has hot water from a kind of thermal heating device Hannah has rigged up. After his bath, he goes to the wooden cabinet and finds a razor made of shells roped together inside a swivel mechanism. While he’s having an excellent shave, Moshe thinks, "Hannah is unbelievable, truly amazing - whatever will I discover next? She can do anything."

When he returns, Hannah greets him wearing only a few carefully placed vine leaves and smelling of honeysuckle - she looks utterly fantastic. Hanna beckons Moshe to sit next to her, which he does. Hannah smiles at Moshe in a seductive manner and slithers up closer to him.

"Moshe," she says, staring into his eyes, "we've both been out here for 10 weeks. Now you’ve found me, is there something you really feel like doing right now, something you've been longing to do for all these weeks. You know..."

Moshe can't believe it. "You mean …… I can check my e-mail from here?"

### #1252 Horse for sale

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Moshe goes to an outdoor sale. As he is walking around the grounds, he sees a sign saying   LUIGI HAS NICE THINGS FOR SALE

He goes up to Luigi’s pitch and immediately sees that Luigi owns a horse. Moshe has always wanted his own horse, so he says to Luigi, "Excuse me but do you want to sell me your horse?"

Luigi replies, "I would sell it but it no looka so good."

Moshe says, "Well he looks fine to me. How much do you want for it?"

Luigi says, "But as I tella you, I canna sell him to you - he no looka so good."

Moshe says, "OK, I'll give you £1,000 for your horse. Final offer. What do you say?"

Luigi shrugs his shoulders and agrees. After writing out a cheque, Moshe gets on the horse and gallops off. But after no more than one minute of riding, the horse suddenly rides straight into an oak tree at speed and is killed.

Moshe is lucky to be alive and goes straight back to Luigi. "You thieving son of a bitch, you sold me a blind horse."

Luigi replies, "I tella you he no looka so good."

"So give me this advice, already," says Mervyn.

"OK, here it is," replies Abe, "the way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you've started."

"Really?" says Mervyn.

"Yes," replies Abe. "I looked around to see all the things I had started but hadn’t finished. So, I finished one bottle of white wine, a bottle of red wine, a bottle of Port, my Prozac, 3 bottles of beer and a large box of organic chocolates. You have no idea how good I felt."

"Kin-a-hora, he’s a healthy 88 years old," she replies.

"Well, Sadie," says the doctor, "I don’t think you need worry. Sexual performance always begins to drop off in men of advanced years. It’s normal. But tell me, when did you first notice Moshe’s failing performance?"

Sadie replies, "I noticed it twice last night, doctor and once again this morning."

### #1257 Naomi’s toy

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Little Naomi lives near a fire station. One day, one of the firemen is surprised to see Naomi glide slowly past the station in a small red fire engine. It is an expensive toy. It has little ladders hooked up on either side, an extendable ladder on top and a garden hose coiled up at the back. Naomi is sitting in the driver’s seat wearing a yellow fireman’s helmet and the fire engine is being pulled by both her dog and her cat. The fireman walks over to her.

"Wow," he says, "you’ve got a real nice fire engine, missy. I wish I had one like this."

"Thank you," says Naomi, "it’s my favourite toy."

But then the fireman is shocked when he notices how Naomi has connected her pets to the fire engine – she’s tied one rope to her dog's collar and a second rope to her cat's testicles.

"I have an idea," he says to her, "if you were to tie that rope around your cat's collar instead, I think you would go even faster."

After thinking about this for a little while, Naomi replies, "You're probably right, but then I wouldn't have a siren."

Sophia and Hannah are discussing the best ways to make their young sons finish their meals. Sophia says, "As an Italian mother, I put on a fierce look and say to Primo, ‘if you don’t finish your meal, I’m going to kill you.’ It works most of the time."

"Well, as a Jewish mother, I look mine Isaac in his eyes and say, ‘if you don’t eat the meal I’ve slaved over all day, I’m going to kill myself.’ It works every time."

### #1260 The procession in Marbella

Benny and Leah are on holiday in Marbella and decide to go to a bullfight. While they are watching the grand procession which takes place before the bullfights commences, Leah starts asking a lot of questions. Fortunately, Benny had been to a bullfight some years earlier during a business trip and is able to answer them.

"Benny, who’s that leading the procession?" asks Leah.

"That’s the toreador, Leah."

"So who’s that behind the toreador?"

"That’s the matador, Leah."

"And who’s that man behind the matador, Benny?"

"That’s the picador, Leah," says Benny, a little fed up with all the questions.

"And who’s the little man behind the picador?" asks Leah.

"That’s Isadore, the kosher butcher."

### #1261 The phone calls

One evening, Moshe shows his wife their latest telephone bill. "Hette, you just have to cut down on your calls. This bill is for over £700 and that’s a very high cost for just 3 months."

"You’re right, darling," she says, "I promise to do my best to curtail my calls."

"Thanks," says Moshe.

Moshe starts to monitor the calls on a daily basis and is pleased to see that Hette is keeping to her promise. But then gradually, as he thought would happen, he sees the daily elapsed time start to increase again.  Then one evening, as Hette dials a number and makes another call, Moshe decides to discuss the situation with her when she puts down the phone, whenever that will be. Fifteen minutes later, Hette puts down the phone.

"What a surprise," says Moshe sarcastically, "how come such a short call?"

"Oh, it was a wrong number, darling." she says.

"No, what Hymie?"

"Mine Rivka," continues Hymie, "is very knowledgeable. She reads the Times newspaper every day from front to back; she watches the news on TV every hour; she reads all kinds of books and she regularly goes to evening classes. She is so up-to-date about current affairs that she can talk all night on any subject."

"So what?" says Monty, "Mine Sadie doesn’t need a subject."

### #1265 Wrong one

[My thanks to Ian $ Oz for the following]

Monty is out on one of his favourite walks – the one through Hampstead Heath, when all of a sudden he gets a strong pain in his stomach and has a desperate need to go to the toilet. As he can’t wait, he goes deep into some thick bushes so no one can see him, lowers his trousers and pants and squats down. Naturally, Monty has not brought any toilet paper with him, so (you should excuse him) he wipes himself with some leaves from a nearby bush, gets dressed and continues on his walk.

But after 5 minutes, his toches starts to itch and after 10 minutes, the itch is almost unbearable. Monty cuts short his walk and goes straight to his doctor.  After a brief examination, doctor Myers says, "Monty, I believe you’ve wiped yourself with some poison ivy."

"Oy veh," cries Monty, "what can I do? The itching is driving me crazy."

"Don't worry," replies doctor Myers, "here’s some powder developed just for this purpose. Go home right away, put one teaspoon of powder in a gallon of warm water and soak your toches in it for 20-30 minutes. If you repeat this every three hours, it will take away the itching."

So Monty goes home, puts a teaspoon of the powder into a large pot he finds in the bottom kitchen cupboard, fills it with warm water, puts the pot down in the middle of the kitchen floor, takes off all his clothes and sits in the pot. What bliss!

But then his Sarah comes home. She enters the kitchen, sees him sitting naked in her new pot in the middle of her kitchen floor and shouts out, "Monty, bist meshugga?"

Monty replies, "Vos tist du?" and tries to tell her about his walk in the woods, his need to go to the toilet, the poison ivy, the doctor and the powder.

But Sarah screams, "Nem aroyse dien flayshedika toches fun der milchedika tepple."

### #1266 All’s fair in love and war

Kitty and Freda are having lunch together at Brent Cross shopping centre. They know how big the portions are so they order only one dish of ‘fried fish pieces’ which they intend to share. They also ask for an extra plate. When the order arrives, the plate contains one big piece of fish and one little piece of fish. Kitty and Freda politely look at each other.

Kitty says, "Please, you choose first."

"No," replies Freda, "you can choose first."

Kitty says, "OK, I'll take first," and puts the big piece of fish on the empty plate.

Freda is surprised. "Why did you take the big piece? That's not very polite."

"So which piece would you have taken, then?" asks Kitty.

"I would have taken the small piece," replies Freda.

"So what’s the problem, Freda," says Kitty, "that's what you’ve got."

### #1269 The court proceedings

[My thanks to Frank for the following]

Judge Allen enters Court number 1 and sits down. He feels ready for the day's business. However, the first case involves Moshe Cohen and as soon as Judge Allen sees this elderly man with his long white beard, peyess (side curls) and kippot, without even asking a question, he says to the court clerk, "Get me a translator."

When the translator arrives, Judge Allen points to Moshe and says to the translator, "Ask him his name, his age and where he’s from."

The translator says to Moshe, "Die judge vilt vissen, vos is dein namen, vie alt bist du, and fun vie kumst du?"

Moshe smiles, looks at Judge Allen and replies in perfect English, "Your honour, my name is Moshe Cohen, I shall be 82 tomorrow and I live in Oxford University where I’m professor of Hebrew Philosophy."

The translator then turns to Judge Allen and says, "Ehr zukt, ehr is Moshe Cohen, ehr is tzwei und achtzig yur alt, und ehr is, mit sach Yiddish philisoph, areingekummen fun Oxford."

A smart-arse sitting at the back of the class raised his hand and asked, "What would you say, teacher, if tomorrow I said I couldn’t come in because I was suffering from complete and utter sexual exhaustion?"

The entire class did its best to stifle their laughter. When silence was restored, Rivkah smiled sympathetically at the student, shook her head, and replied, "Well, I guess I’d say you'd have to write the exam with your other hand."

### #1276 The anniversary cruise

[My thanks to Ian $ Oz for the following]

Bernie and Faye, a wealthy couple, are coming up to their Ruby wedding anniversary and Faye has been thinking for some months about how they should celebrate. Then she comes to a decision. "Bernie," she says, "I'm going to book us a wonderful 6 weeks cruise. I know you don't like ships because you got sea sick last time, but trust me, this one will be perfect for us. It’s called ‘Bubbeh of the Sea,’ an intimate seven-star luxury liner with everything kosher we could ever want to eat made available. Let’s give it a go."

Bernie certainly isn't pleased with Faye’s decision, but who is he to argue - he could never win. So he says, "OK dear."

On the day of the cruise, Bernie and Faye drive up to the quay in their Bugatti Veyron 16.4. Captain Cohen is on the bridge as they pass by and calls in the purser. "Find out who they are and invite them to dine at my table tonight."

Later, the purser knocks on the door of the Royal State Room. When Faye answers the door, the purser says, "Compliments of Captain Cohen, madam. He would very much like you both to dine with him this evening."

Bernie comes to the door and says, "Who is it Faye, is there a problem?"

"This man says that Captain Cohen wants us to eat with him this evening," replies Faye.

"I told you we shouldn't have come," says Bernie, "seven-star or no seven-star, we have only been on this boat half-an-hour and already we have to eat with the crew."

### #1277 Almost converted

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Christine and Daniel fall in love and decide to get married - but only on condition that Christine becomes Jewish. So she goes to see Rabbi Levy for some advice.

Rabbi Levy tells her, "You will have to learn how to keep a kosher home, light shabbes candles, keep two sets of crockery and a few other simple things."

"That sounds easy to me, rabbi," says Christine, "I can easily do that."

Then Rabbi Levy says, "The last thing is, you must go to a mikva."

"A mikva?" says Christine, "what's that?"

"It's a pool of water," answers Rabbi Levy, "and you must immerse yourself completely for a few seconds."

"I'm sorry, rabbi, but I have a phobia about putting my head underwater. I'll go into the water up to my chin but I won’t put my head under the water. Will that be OK?"

"I suppose it will do," replies Rabbi Levy, "you’ll be mostly Jewish but you will still have a 'Goyisha kop'."

### #1278 Salty story

[My thanks to Daniel R for the following]

Aaron is out shopping in Golders Green when he remembers that he has guests coming over for tea and needs to buy some tea bags. He goes into ‘Moshe the Grocer’ and starts looking for tea bags.  As he walks down the first aisle, he can’t help but notice that all the shelves are packed with bags of salt. Shelf after shelf, in aisle after aisle, all packed with bags of salt. So he calls for the manager.

"Can I help you?" says Moshe.

"Yes you can," replies Aaron, "I’ve come in here to buy some tea bags and all I can find is salt. What kind of grocer do you call yourself? It’s a bit pointless, isn’t it, just selling salt? I just don’t believe you can sell all this salt."

"I couldn’t agree with you more," says Moshe, "I personally can’t sell much salt, but oy veh, the sales rep who sold me the salt – can he sell salt!"

### #1279 The lawyer’s lament

[My thanks to Stan for the following]

Moshe the lawyer arrived home at 10pm and opened his front door. He was shattered after a day of trying to get a stay of execution for William Rite. This client of Moshe’s was due to be executed for murder at midnight and his last minute plea for clemency had failed. So as he entered his house, Moshe was understandably feeling very tired and depressed.

But when Moshe walked in, there was his Hetty waiting for him. "So what time of night do you call this?" she shouted at him, "Where have you been?"

Too weary to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, Moshe walked past her, went into the front room, poured himself a large whiskey, downed it in one go, then headed upstairs for a relaxing hot bath – all the time pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks.

The phone rang while Moshe was in the bath and when Hetty answered it, she was told that Moshe’s client had been granted his stay of execution after all. Quickly realising what a day Moshe must have had, she felt sorry for him and went upstairs to give him the good news. As Hetty opened the bathroom door, all she saw of Moshe was his naked rear view as he was bending over drying his feet. "They're not hanging Rite tonight," she said to Moshe.

Immediately, Moshe whirled around and screamed hysterically, "For crying out loud, Hetty, don't you ever stop?"

"Dry?" asks the waiter.

"No," replies Rivka, "tzvei iz genug (two is enough)."

### #1282 At the races

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Jacob goes to the races for the first time. As soon as he arrives at Ascot, not knowing anything about horse racing, he goes straight to the paddock to take a closer look. To his surprise, Jacob sees a rabbi blessing one of the horses. Jacob thinks he must be onto a good thing so he writes down the number of the horse and places a £3 bet on it. The horse wins and Jacob wins £21.

Jacob immediately returns to the paddock and there, as before, he sees the rabbi blessing another horse. He writes down the number of this horse and bets his £21 winnings on it. It comes in first and Jacob now has over £100.

This process goes on race after race until Jacob has won £4,650.

It’s now time for the last race of the day and Jacob watches the rabbi bless the final horse. So confident is Jacob that, although the horse is a 20-1 outsider, he bets his entire £4,650 on it. But, Oy Veh, this time the horse struggles in last, a good 20 lengths behind the field.

Jacob is so upset with this outcome that he runs over to the rabbi and says angrily, "Why did every horse you bless win except the last one, rabbi? He came in last."

The rabbi replies, "That's the problem with you Reform Jews. You don't know the difference between a brocheh and a kaddish."

"No, not even on her best days," Monty replies.

"And will she buy you expensive presents like I always do? Will she take you on holidays and pay for the trips as I do?"

"No, she can’t - she's not rich like you, she’s very poor."

"Well then," sobs Leah, "is it the sex? Has she done things to you better than I’ve done?"

"Absolutely no," replies Monty, "nobody makes love better than you."

"Then what on earth can she do that I can't?" Leah asks.

"Sue me for child support," replies Monty.

• Is there another word for synonym?

### #1285 The converts

[My thanks to Ian $ Oz for the following]

Benjamin is offered a high powered job as Head of Finance at Utah Life Assurance Inc. He and his Sarah sell their house in New York and move to Utah. But Benjamin is unaware that it had been a difficult decision for the ULA President to offer him the job.

Even after Benjamin starts work, the ULA directors continue to put pressure on the President behind Benjamin’s back. "We’re all Mormons on the board and we’ve never had someone Jewish on the board before. We find this very difficult to accept."  But they also know that Benjamin is proving to be the best. He’s a financial genius, a financial guru.

After much careful thought, the President decides on a course of action and calls Benjamin to his office. "I’m afraid I’ve run into some opposition to your appointment. If you want to keep your $400,000 a year position, you’ll have to convert.  Please let me know by tomorrow what you decide."

Benjamin has no choice. However difficult it might be to convert, it’s easier than losing his great new job. So he goes home and tells Sarah, "It’s simple, from this Sunday we’ll be going to church with our children."

Over the months that follow, Sarah doesn’t stop nagging. "It’s so difficult for me…I miss shul…shabbes….lighting the candles…kiddush…festivals etc. You know Benjamin, money isn’t everything."

The more she nags him, the worse Benjamin’s conscience bothers him, until finally he’s had enough. He goes back to the ULA President. "I can’t go on like this, sir, my troubles are eating me up inside. Money isn’t everything to me. Neither I nor Sarah can sleep at night.  It’s too much for us. I made the wrong decision. We were born Jews and we want to die Jews. If you want me to quit, I’ll go without making a fuss."

The president looks at him in amazement and says, "Listen Benjamin, I had no idea it was so tough for you. I thought switching religions would be simple. But you are doing an excellent job here and I don’t want to loose you. Stay here and you can be as Jewish as you want - I’ll take care of the directors."

Benjamin goes home to Sarah feeling absolutely great. "Our troubles are over at last, darling," he says to her, "I’ve spoken to the President and he’s letting me keep my job and he said we can go back to being Jewish immediately."

Sarah looks at him with anger in her eyes. "Tell me, are you stupid or what?"

Benjamin is shocked. "But I thought that was what you wanted all along, to be Jewish once more. Don’t you want to go back to being Jewish?"

Sarah looks very upset and replies, "Of course I do, but now, just 2 weeks before Pesach?"

### #1286 Aren’t children fantastic?

[My thanks to Sue for the following]

1. I was driving with my three young children one warm summer evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and waved. She was stark naked. I was still in shock when I heard my 5 year old daughter Suzy shout from the back, "Mummy, she isn't wearing a seat belt."

2. My 4 year old son Benjy came running out of the bathroom to tell me he'd dropped his toothbrush down the toilet. So I fished it out and threw it in the bin. Benjy stood there thinking for a moment, then ran to my bathroom and came out with my toothbrush. He held it up and said with a charming little smile, "We better throw this one out too then mummy, because it fell in the toilet a few days ago.

3. Little Moshe got lost at the Maccabi club and found himself in the women's changing room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running to hide. Moshe watched in amazement and shouted, "What's wrong, haven't you ever seen a little boy before?"

4. While working for my shul delivering lunches to elderly Jewish women living at home, I used   to take my 4 year old daughter Esther with me. She was always intrigued by the various appliances of old age, such as walking sticks, zimmer frames and wheelchairs. One day I found Esther staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a   glass of water. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, "The tooth fairy will never believe this."

5. When 4 year old Sam opened the family bible, something fell out of it. He picked up the object and looked at it. It was old leaf that had been pressed between the pages. "Mummy, look what I found," he said. "What have you found, bubbeleh?" I asked. Sam replied, "I think it's Adam's underwear."

"Surely I don’t have to remind you," she replies, "that we are so poor, my mother buys our kosher food, my father pays our mortgage and your sister buys our clothes. Why, even your aunt has just bought us a car. Aren’t you just a little bit ashamed?"

Howard sits up on the couch and replies, "You should be ashamed too. Benjy and Jacob, your two worthless brothers, have never given us a penny."

### #1293 Sinai tourist

Peter, a tourist wondering through the Sinai desert, gets lost and very soon is very tired and desperate for some water.  Then, just when he had given up hope, he sees in the distance a tiny oasis, consisting of a few palm trees.  When he arrives, he sees a sign saying MOSHE’S TIE WAREHOUSE and there, sitting under one of the trees in the shade is Moshe himself.

Moshe is reading the Jerusalem Post. Next to him is a table displaying dozens of different kinds of patterned coloured ties. So Peter goes over to Moshe and asks for some water.

Moshe says, "I'm sorry, but I don't have any water. However, since you're here, would you like to buy a tie?"

Peter is angry. "What good is a tie to me in my condition? Can't you see that all I need is some water? You know where you can stuff your fancy ties."

Moshe says, "It’s no good being rude to me. If you don’t want a tie, then don’t buy a tie. Whether you do or not is up to you. But the fact of the matter is that I still don’t have any water for you."

As Peter begins to walk away, Moshe calls him back and pointing, says, "OK, I'll tell you where you can get some water. If you walk in that direction for about 30 minutes, you’ll come to a restaurant.  It's owned by my brother Max and there you'll be able to get plenty of food and water. So Peter starts walking and soon disappears over the sand dunes. Moshe just continues to read his paper.

Two hours later Peter returns to Moshe’s Tie Warehouse, crawling on his hands and knees. He is now extremely desperate for water and practically on his last breath. Moshe asks, "So what happened? Didn't you find Max’s restaurant? "

"Oh, I found the restaurant alright," gasped Peter, "but Max wouldn't let me in without a tie."

### #1295 Reception meeting

[My thanks to Ian for the following]

Yossel the Hassid is in London on business. It’s now one hour to shabbes and he’s all dressed up in his special shabbes clothes ready to go to a local shul. He takes the lift to the ground floor and walks towards the exit. As he reaches the reception area, he sees a stunning British Airways air hostess with blond hair and a face and figure he could die for. She has just checked in. As soon as she sees Yossel, she stops in her tracks and walks quickly over to him.

"Hello," she says to him.

"Hello to you too," he says.

"I have a confession to make," she says.

"What is it?" he asks.

"I have a sexual fantasy," she says.

"Nu, so go on," he says.

"I’ve always wanted to be with a Hassidic man. I want to run my hands up and down his white silk socks, run my hands over his tzitzis and my fingers through his beard, play with his peyess, eat kichel with him, poke my finger in his puppik, remove his gatkes, play with his shlong and then shtup. So I want you to join me now. I have a room upstairs just waiting for us. What do you say?"

Yossel looks at her thoughtfully and says, "And what's in it for me?"

### #1296 After my check-up

[My thanks to Daniel S for the following]

Moshe and his friends Abe, Max and Nathan meet at Brent Cross shopping centre for a coffee - as they do every Monday. They sit down and Moshe starts to discuss the importance of regular medical check-ups. He asks his friends, "So when did you all last have a medical?" All reply it was years ago. So Moshe tells them of doctor Myers, a wonderful doctor he went to and who gave him the best examination he’s ever had. He suggests they each contact doctor Myers and book a check-up ASAP. They agree to do so and take down the doctor’s phone number.

The following Monday, Moshe asks his friends, "Nu, how went the medicals?"

"After my check-up," says Abe, "doctor Myers asked me how old I was. I said I was seventy and he said I could expect to live another 30 years. I was so relieved and happy to hear that."

"After my check-up," says Max, "doctor Myers also asked me how old I was. When I said I was eighty he said I could expect to live another 20 years. You can’t believe how fantastic it was for an eighty-year old to hear that."

Nathan is looking very sad and doesn’t say anything at first. But Moshe eventually persuades him to discuss how his medical went. "Being older than all of you," says Nathan, "I have been loathe to see a doctor. But when Moshe told us of doctor Myers, I reluctantly booked to see him. After my check-up, the doctor asked me how old I was. When I said I was ninety, he looked at me and said, ‘Thanks for coming. Have a nice day.’"

### #1297 Heavenly home

[My thanks to Ian $ Oz for the following]

Yitzhak and Sharon have been eating the healthiest and most organic of foods for over 10 years – mainly at the insistence of Sharon. She also ensures that they regularly attend keep fit classes, so although they are in their 80s, they are both in excellent health.  But their good health doesn’t help them when their car collides with a lorry on the M25 motorway and they’re both killed.

When they reach Heaven, a guide takes them to a beautiful house, furnished in gold and fine silks. All their favourite clothes are hanging in the bedroom’s wardrobes and the kitchen is fully stocked. There is even a waterfall in the house’s extensive grounds. Yitzhak and Sharon are thrilled when the guide says, "Welcome to your new home."

In their previous life, they were not very well off and survived by watching their pennies, so Yitzhak asks, "How much is this going to cost?"

"Nothing," replies the guide, "this is your reward in Heaven."

Yitzhak looks out the window. To the left of the waterfall is a golf course, more beautiful than any he’d seen on Earth. "What are the green fees?" he asks.

"This is heaven," replies the guide, "you can play for free, every day."

The guide then takes them into to the clubhouse. "Wow!" says Yitzhak, when he sees the lavish buffet lunch laid out before them. There is every kind of food, from seafood to steaks to exotic desserts, and plenty of alcohol.

"Don't even ask," says the guide, "this is Heaven, it’s all free for you to enjoy."

Yitzhak looks around, glances nervously at Sharon and asks, "Where are the low fat and low cholesterol foods, and the decaffeinated coffee?"

"That's the best part," replies the guide, "you can eat and drink as much as you like of whatever you like, and you’ll never get fat or sick. This is Heaven!"

Yitzhak says "No gym to work out at?"

"Not unless you want to," replies the guide.

"No testing of my sugar, cholesterol or blood pressure?"

"Never again. All you do here is enjoy yourself," replies the guide.

On hearing all this, Yitzhak glares at Sharon and says, "If it wasn’t for your stupid bran cereals, your yucky unsweetened green teas, your tasteless unsalted crisps, your silly small portions, your watery alcohol-free Kiddush wine and your mind-numbingly low fat everything, we could have been here ten years ago!"

### #1300 The fishing trip

Lionel, Benny, Max and Hyman are out fishing early one Sunday morning. After an hour of fishing, Lionel suddenly breaks the silence and says, "You three have no idea what I had to do before I could come out fishing today. I had to promise my Rivkah that I would decorate our bedroom next Sunday."

"That's nothing," says Benny, "I had to promise my Leah that I would build her a new terrace by the swimming pool."

"Well," says Max, "you both had it easy. I had to promise my Sharon that I would completely refit our kitchen with new mahogany cupboards and the latest state of the art equipment."

But Hyman has not said a word so they ask him what he did to come out fishing. Hyman replies, "I just set my alarm for 5.30 am. When it went off, I gave my Faye a firm nudge and said, ‘Fishing or Sex?’ She replied, "Don’t forget your sweater."

### #1301  Medical disciplines

It’s the funeral of Moshe the cardiologist and Avrahom and Hymie are there to pay their last respects.  Behind Moshe’s coffin stands a huge red heart covered in hundreds of flowers. Following the eulogy, the heart suddenly opens, the coffin moves slowly inside and the heart shuts, enclosing Moshe inside the beautiful heart forever. Avrahom immediately bursts out laughing.

"What’s so funny?" asks one of the congregation.

"I'm sorry," replies Avrahom, "but I can’t help thinking of my own funeral - I'm a gynaecologist."

Hymie, the proctologist, then faints.

### #1302 How sad

[My thanks to Henry M for the following]

Moshe meets his friend in Hendon.  "Hi Abe, how are things with you?"

"OK, I suppose," replies Abe, rather gloomily.

"So why the long face?" asks Moshe.

“Because I just found a full pay packet in the gutter, that’s why," answers Abe.

"Well surely that’s no reason to be miserable?" says Moshe.

"It is -  when you see how much the Inland Revenue has taxed me," replies Abe

### #1303 Prevention policy

Nathan goes to see his doctor. After a lengthy examination the doctor sighs, looks Nathan in the eye and says, "I've some bad news for you, Nathan. You have an incurable cancer.  I suggest you quickly put your affairs in order."

Nathan is initially shocked. But then, being a calm, solid character, he composes himself and quietly leaves the doctor's office. His son Max is waiting for him.

"Max," says Nathan, "we Jews celebrate when things are good and we sometimes celebrate when things are not so good. In my case, Max, things aren't so good - I have cancer. So I suggest we go to my golf club for a few drinks."

4 or 5 glasses of whiskey later, the two are feeling a little less sad. Then, after a few laughs and some more glasses of whiskey, they are approached by two of Nathan's club mates, curious as to what Nathan and Max are celebrating.

Nathan tells them, "Guys, we’re drinking to my impending death. I’ve been diagnosed with AIDS."

His club mates are shocked. They give Nathan their condolences, have a couple of beers and leave. Max then says, "Dad, you tell me you’re dying of cancer yet you tell your friends you’re dying of AIDS. I don’t understand."

Nathan replies, "I don't want any of them sleeping with your Mum after I’m gone."

### #1304 Adult hide and seek

[My thanks to Nat A for the following]

Mary and Naomi arrive at the pearly gates at the same time and soon start to discuss how they died. Mary says, "I froze to death."

"Oy veh! What a horrible way to die," remarks Naomi.

"It wasn't so bad, really," says Mary, "After I stopped shaking from the cold, I began to feel warm and sleepy and not long after, I died quite peacefully. What about you? How did you die?"

Naomi replies, "I died of a massive heart attack."

"So how did it happen?" asks Mary.

"I felt sure that mine Bernie was cheating on me with a shiksa, so I came home early to try to catch them in the act. But when I crept into the house, I found Bernie alone watching TV."

"So then what happened?" asks Mary.

Naomi replies, "Well, I was sure there was another woman somewhere in the house so I started running all over the place looking for her. I ran upstairs and searched every one of my 8 bedrooms and their en-suite bathrooms, checking under every king-sized bed. I searched the games room and then ran downstairs into the garage and looked inside our Bentley convertible. I went through every room in the house checking every cupboard and looking behind every designer curtain. I even went into our loft. I was running around like a meshuggeneh. Finally, exhausted and stressed, I just keeled over with a heart attack and died."

"Too bad you didn't look in the freezer," says Mary. "If you had, we'd both still be alive."

### #1306 The delivery

The new postman is delivering a registered parcel and needs a signature so he rings the doorbell. Sadie sticks her head out of the bedroom window and says, "Nu, what is it?"

"I have a registered parcel for Mrs Levy," he replies.

"Is it wrapped in fancy gift paper or just plain brown paper?" Sadie asks.

"Ordinary brown paper, madam," he replies.

"So who is it from?" Sadie asks.

"It’s from John Lewis department store, madam," he replies.

"Does it say from which branch?" Sadie asks.

"Yes, madam," he replies, "it’s from Oxford Street."

"Does it say what’s in it?" Sadie asks.

"It says it’s from their Writing Instruments department," he replies. "Will you now come down and sign for it, please."

"Sorry," replies Sadie, "I can’t do that."

"Why not?" he asks.

"Because," Sadie replies, "I’m Sadie Cohen. Mrs Levy lives next door."

### #1307 The rabbi’s sermons

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

The shabbes service finishes and the congregation is invited to a kiddush in the shul hall. During the kiddush, Mordechai goes over to Rabbi Bloom, shakes his hand and says, "Rabbi, you gave a good sermon today - you should have it published."

"Thank you," says Rabbi Bloom, "but just between you and me, I’m planning to have all my sermons published posthumously."

"That’s good news," says Mordechai, "and the sooner the better."

### #1308 The handywoman

Rivkah, a beautiful blonde, is fed up being typecast by men as silly, useless, and starry-eyed. "I’m as good as most men I meet," she says to herself and makes a decision to prove it - she will earn some decent money by hiring herself out as a handyman.

First thing next morning, Rivkah begins canvassing the wealthy Hampstead neighbourhood and starts by ringing the bell of the first house in the first road she comes to. This happens to be Moshe and Leah’s house. When Moshe opens his door, Rivkah asks him if he has any jobs for her to do. "Well, my porch needs painting. How much will you charge me?"

Rivkah thinks for a while, then replies, "£40."

"OK," says Moshe, "you’re hired. You’ll find the paint, paintbrushes, primers, scrapers and other such tools in my garage. It’s not locked."

When Rivka goes into the garage, Leah says to Moshe, "Do you think the girl realises that we have a very large porch?"

"That’s up to her to have found out," replies Moshe, "let’s leave her to it."

Thirty minutes later, Rivkah knocks on the door to collect her money.

"You're finished already?" asks Moshe.

"Yes," replies Rivkah, "and as I had paint left over, I gave it an extra coat."

Impressed, Moshe reaches into his pocket for his wallet. But before he could pull it out, Rivkah says, "And by the way, it's not a Porch, It's a Ferrari."

### #1309 Furniture moves

Rivkah gets into work late one Monday morning and goes to see her boss to apologise. "I’m sorry I’m late, but I had to move some furniture this morning before I came into work. In fact my back is killing me after my efforts."

"So why didn’t you wait until your husband gets home tonight?" asks her boss.

"I could have," says Rivkah, "but the couch is easier to move if he's not on it."

### #1310 The funeral procession

One morning, as Sarah is leaving Starbucks with her usual take-away coffee, she notices an unusual funeral procession coming along the road towards her. At the front is a large black hearse and 20 yards behind this is a second black hearse. A solitary woman is walking behind the second hearse with an Alsatian on a lead. Behind the woman are 50 other women walking single file.

Sarah is very curious and goes over to the woman with the dog and says, "I’m sorry about your loss."

"Thank you," says the woman, "you’re very kind."

"I know it’s a bad time to ask," says Sarah, "but whose funeral is this?"

"It’s my husband's funeral," replies the woman.

"So what happened to him?" asks Sarah.

The woman replies, "My dog attacked and killed him."

"And who is in the second hearse?" asks Sarah.

The woman answers, "My mother-in-law. She was trying to help my husband when the dog turned on her."

A poignant and thoughtful moment of silence passes between the two women.

"Can I borrow the dog?" asks Sarah.

"Go to the back of the line," replies the woman.

### #1312 The hot spot

Unusually for a mid August day in Golders Green, it’s very, very hot. Sadie has been busy. She’s washed the floor, made the evening’s roast meal and taken the washing out of the washing machine and hung them up. Then she leaves the house to go pick up some dry cleaning. As Sadie walks to the shops, she’s perspiring profusely so when she comes to a pub, she says to herself, "Gootness, it's hotter dan hell today, so vy nodt? I must go ged a drink or I’ll pass out."

She enters. When the bartender asks what she would like to drink, all she can think of is a cold beer, her Nathan’s favourite drink when he’s hot. So she replies, "Ya know, it is zo hot, I tink I'll have myself a cold beer."

"Anheuser Busch?" asks the bartender.

Sadie blushes and replies, "Vell fine, tanks, und how's yu pecker?"

### #1313 The stupid golfer

[My thanks to Hilary for the following joke]

Hymie is an avid golfer (if truth be known, he's a golf fanatic). Every Sunday morning he gets up at 6am because he has an early tee time. He then plays golf all day long.

One Sunday morning, Hymie gets up early as usual, dresses quietly so as not to disturb his Leah, gets his clubs out of the study and goes to his car. But it’s raining torrentially, there is snow mixed with the rain and the wind is blowing at 50 mph. So he goes back into the house, finds the weather channel on the internet and discovers that it's going to be terrible weather all day long.

He then puts his clubs back into the study, quietly undresses, slips back into bed, cuddles up to Leah’s back and whispers, "The weather’s terrible."

Without moving, Leah replies, "Can you believe my meshugga Hymie is out golfing?"

### #1314 Funeral arrangements

Aaron is over 90 years old and is close to death. Nevertheless, he is surprised to overhear his two sons discussing his funeral arrangements. "Let’s order two dozen bottles of whiskey and kosher red wine, plus ten plates each of smoked salmon bagels, egg and onion rolls, shmaltz herring, fish balls, mixed olives, rye bread and cakes, and invite all the mourners back to mum’s house afterwards," says Joshua.

"Are you crazy?" says Mervyn, "That would cost too much. Better we give everyone just a cup of tea and a piece of cake."

"OK," says Joshua, "but I think we should hire ten Rolls Royces to take family and mourners to and from Bushey Cemetery," says Joshua.

"Are you meshugga?" says Mervyn, "That’s much too extravagant. All we need do to save money is hire just one large Ford for you, me and mum. The rest can find their own means of transport."

Just then, Joshua and Mervyn hear Aaron’s faint voice from upstairs. "Mervyn, will you please fetch me a nice clean pair of trousers."

"But dad, you know what the doctor told you," says Mervyn, "you must stay quietly in bed and not over-exert yourself."

"Yes, I know, Mervyn," says his father, "but I’ve decided to walk to Bushey cemetery. It will save you having to hire a hearse."

### #1315 The promise

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Moshe is driving to Golders Green where he has an important meeting to attend. But when he gets there, he can’t find a place to park. He drives around, he waits, he even tries a bit farther away, but all in vain. So in desperation he looks up at the sky and says, "Oh Lord, if you will find me a parking place in the next five minutes, I promise you I will stop gambling, I’ll eat only kosher food, I’ll stop going with shiksas and I’ll observe shabbes properly."

Almost immediately, he sees a car pulling out of its parking place and quickly takes its place. Again Moshe looks up at heaven and says, "Oh Lord, there’s no need for you to find me a parking place - I've already found one."

---

### #1316 Not like me

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Max leaves his house to hail a taxi and almost immediately finds one. As he gets in, the cabbie says, "Perfect timing, just like Hymie."

"Who’s Hymie?" asks Max.

"Hymie Gold, of course," says the cabbie, "now there's someone who got what he wanted - like a taxi just when he needed it. Not like me - I always have to wait ages when I need something."

"No one’s perfect," says Max.

"Except Hymie," says the cabbie. "Hymie was a great athlete and could have played football for Arsenal. Not like me - I’m just a couch potato."

"So am I," says Max.

"And," says the cabbie, "Hymie danced like Astaire. Not like me – I’ve got two left feet."

"Sounds like Hymie was really someone special," says Max.

"You can say that again," says the cabbie. "He even remembered everyone’s birthday. Not like me - I always forget important birthdays and anniversaries. And Hymie could fix anything in the house. Not like me - if I change a fuse, the whole neighbourhood has a power failure."

"Wow," says Max, "there aren’t many men around like Hymie."

The cabbie continues. "And Hymie knew how to treat a woman. He could always make her feel good and never answered her back even if she was in the wrong. Not like me - I’m always getting into arguments with my wife."

"What an amazing person," says Max, "how did you meet him?"

"Well, I never actually met Hymie," replies the cabbie.

"Then how do you know so much about him?" asks Max.

"I married his widow," replies the cabbie.

### #1317 A father’s memory

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Benjy is visiting Brent Cross shopping centre one day when a beautiful woman comes up to him and with a smile on her face says, "Hello!"

Benjy looks at her and can’t remember seeing her before.

Noticing the blank look on his face, she thinks she must be mistaken and apologizes. "I'm really sorry," she says, "but when I first saw you, I thought you were the father of one of my children." She then walks away.

Benjy at first thinks, "What’s the world coming to when a woman can't keep track of the fathers of her children?"

Then he panics, thinking, "But just because I don't remember her, what if she was at one of the wild parties I attended when I was at University? Maybe I did father her child."

So he catches up with her and asks, "Are you the girl I met at a party at Oxford University and then we got really drunk and had wild sex behind the boat house?"

"Oh no", she replies, with a horrified look on her face, "I'm your son's second grade teacher."

### #1320 Wedding night advice

Joe is talking to his soon-to-be-married son Abe. "Let me give you some advice, Abe. On my wedding night, I took off my trousers, handed them to your mother and said, ‘Here try these on.’  Your mother did as she was told and said, ‘These are too big - I can't wear them.’  So I said to her, ‘And don’t you forget it. I wear the trousers in our house and always will.’ Ever since that night, we have never had any problems."

Abe thought this was such good advice that on his honeymoon, he takes off his trousers and says to his bride, "Here Rifka, try these on."

She does, then says, "But these are too large - they don't fit me."

Abe says, "Exactly. I wear the trousers in our house and always will. I don't want you to ever forget that."

So Rifka takes off her panties, hands them to Abe and says, "Here, you try on mine."

Abe tries but has to admit, "I can't get into your panties."

Rifka responds, "Exactly. And if you don't change your smart-ass attitude, you never will."

### #1321 Regular sex

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Hyman and Sadie, an elderly couple, go for their annual medical. Hyman goes in first and after examining him, doctor Cohen says, "You appear to be in good health, Hyman. Do you have any medical concerns you would like to discuss?"

"Yes I do," says Hyman. "After I have sex with mine Sadie, I’m usually hot and sweaty and then, after I have sex with her the second time, I’m usually cold and chilly."

"That’s odd," says doctor Cohen, "I’ll ask Sadie about it when I check her out."

Soon it was Sadie’s turn. After examining her, doctor Cohen says, "Everything appears to be fine, Sadie. Do you have any medical concerns that you would like to discuss with me?"

"No doctor," she replies.

Doctor Cohen then says, "Hyman has an unusual problem. He claims that he is usually hot and sweaty after having sex with you the first time and then cold and chilly after the second time. Can you think of why this might be?"

"Oh that stupid shmuck of a husband of mine," Sadie replies, "it's because we have sex only twice a year - once in the summer and once in the winter."

### #1322 Open-and shut case

Nathan is talking to his solicitor. "Here’s the deal, Abe. If you’re absolutely sure I’ll win the case, I’ll give you the business."

"OK," replies Abe, "but before I can give you my opinion, I obviously need to know the facts."

So Nathan goes into great detail about his failed partnership and ends up saying, "So now you’ve heard everything, do you think I can sue my partner and get my money back?"

"Well," replies Abe, "from what I’ve just heard, it’s clear to me that you will win. It’s rare to have such an open-and-shut case."

Nathan goes very white when he hears this.

"What’s the matter?" asks Abe.

"I told you my partner’s side of the case," replies Nathan.

### #1323 The head strike

Moshe and his friend Issy were half way through a round of golf when a golf ball arrives out of nowhere and strikes Moshe on the back of his head. "Gevalt." Moshe cries out, rubbing the back of his head.

Almost immediately, Hymie arrives to apologise. But Moshe is having none of it.

"You call yourself a golfer?" yells Moshe. "If I had my way, I’d ban you from every North London golf club. Do you see what you’ve done to me? My head is bleeding. I’m going to call my solicitor as soon as I get to the clubhouse. I’ll sue you for £5,000."

"But … but," says Hymie, "didn’t you hear me? I shouted FORE."

"OK," says Moshe, "I’ll take it."

### #1324 The flower streaker

[My thanks to Yvonne S for the following]

Rachel and Fay, two old ladies, are sitting on a bench outside Hendon Town Hall where a flower show is taking place.

Fay leans over to Rachel and says, "Don’t you think life has got very boring? I just don’t seem to have fun anymore. You know what? For £10, I'd take off my clothes and run naked right through that stupid flower show over the road."

"You're on," says Rachel, holding up a £10 note.

So Fay fumbles her way out of her clothes as fast as she can. Then, completely naked, she streaks across the road and into the front door of the flower show, leaving Rachel wondering what will happen next. Rachel doesn’t have long to wait. She hears a huge commotion inside the town hall, followed by loud applause. Then Fay, still naked, bursts out of the building and, followed by a cheering crowd, runs back over to her friend.

"Nu, so what happened?" asks Rachel.

"I won the first prize as Best Dried Arrangement," replies Fay.

### #1325 What a day

One afternoon Max comes home from work to find total mayhem. His two young children are in the front garden, naked, soaking wet and playing with the garden hose. There is food all over the lawn, rubbish spilled everywhere and some of their plants have been pulled up and are lying on the path.

The front door to their house is wide open and there’s no sign of their dog. As Max enters his house, he finds an even bigger mess. The nest of tables are lying on their sides, all the vases have been knocked over and wet flowers are on the floor, the armchair cushions are lying where they were thrown and one of the children has been sick over the carpet.  The TV is blaring out and the children’s room is strewn inches deep with toys and various items of clothing.

Max goes into the kitchen and finds the sink full of unwashed dishes from the morning’s breakfast, none of the food has been cleared up, the fridge door is wide open and there’s dog food on the floor.

He’s quite worried by now and heads up the stairs to look for his wife Fay. He has to step over yet more toys and piles of clothes. He’s worried Fay might be ill, or even worse.

As Max passes the bathroom, water is trickling under the door and into the hall. So he peers inside and sees wet towels, spilt bath oils, his shaver lying on the floor and toothpaste smeared everywhere. He turns off the bath tap and rushes to his bedroom. There he finds Fay.

She’s curled up in bed, still in her pyjamas and reading a book. She smiles at him and says, "How did your day go, darling?"

Max looks at her bewildered and asks, "What happened here today, Fay?"

She again smiles, "You know every day when you come home from work and you ask me what in the world did I do today?"

"Yes," he replies.

"Well," says Fay, "today I didn't do it."

### #1330 The barmitzvah space boy

Abe had done very well in business and had amassed a small fortune. Now he was looking to create the most unique and spectacular barmitzvah ever for his son David. But what should it be? He dismissed the Barmitzvah Safari – too many families had already done it. But then, after much investigation, Abe was sure he had cracked it – he would rent a spaceship and David would be the first barmitzvah space boy. He started on the plans immediately.

In due course, the spaceship took off with his family and friends (and his Rabbi, of course) on board. When they returned, the media was there to find out how the journey had gone.

The first person off the shuttle was the bubbeh.

"How was the service, grandma?" asked the Jewish Chronicle reporter.

"OK," she replied.

"And how was David’s speech?"

"OK."

"So how was the food?"

"OK."

"Everything was just OK? Why aren’t you more enthusiastic? What went wrong?"

"There was no atmosphere."

### #1331 The miser

Jonathan had worked hard all his life and had saved most of his earnings. He was a real miser when came to his money, which he loved more than just about anything.

Just before he died, Jonathan said to his wife, "Now listen, Sarah, when I die, I want you to take all my money and place it in the coffin with me. Please do this because I want to take my money with me to the afterlife. Promise me."

She promised she would.

Finally the day came when Jonathan died. At his funeral, Sarah was with her best friend Rebecca.  After they had buried him, Rebecca said to Sarah, "I hope you weren't stupid to put all that money in there with Jonathan."

Sarah replied, "Well, I promised him - I'm a good Jew and I can't lie.  I promised him that I would put that money in with him."

"You mean to tell me," said Rebecca, "you put every penny of his money in the coffin with him?"

"I sure did," said Sarah, "I got it all together, put it into my bank account and wrote him out a cheque."

### #1332 The Harrow marathon

[My thanks to Michael W for the following]

Sadie from Harrow is having a daytime affair while her husband Cyril is at work. One wet and rainy day she’s in bed with her boyfriend Morris when to her horror she hears Cyril’s car pull into the driveway.  She looks out the window and yells to Morris, "Quick, jump out the window, my husband's home early."

"I can't jump out the window - it's raining," says Morris.

"If my Cyril catches us together, he'll kill us both," she says.  "He's got a jealous temper and a large gun. The rain is the least of your problems."

So Morris gets out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window. As he begins running down the street in the pouring rain, he discovers he’s run right into the middle of the Harrow Marathon. There’s not much he can do but continue to run alongside the real runners. Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tries to blend in as best he can. After a while, a group of runners who have been studying him with some curiosity, jog closer.

"Do you always run in the nude?" asks one of them.

"Oh yes," replies Morris, gasping for air, "it feels so wonderfully free."

Another runner moves alongside. "Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?"

"Oh, yes," Morris answers, breathlessly, "that way I can quickly get dressed at the end of the run and get in my car to go home."

Then a third runner casts his eyes a little lower down and asks Morris, "Do you always wear a condom when you run?"

"Oh no," replies Morris, "only when it's raining."

Adam has been staying out very late for a few nights and Eve becomes quite upset. "What's wrong, darling?" he asks her.

"You're seeing another woman," she replies.

"Eve, darling, you're totally wrong," says Adam. "You know you're the only woman on earth for me."

They continue to argue until Adam falls asleep. But then he is suddenly woken up by a strange pain in his chest. He looks up and sees Eve poking him very vigorously.

"What do you think you're doing?" asks Adam angrily.

"I’m counting your ribs," replies Eve.

### #1335 The system

Bernard and Issy are having a serious chat about women. Bernard says, "Whenever I see a woman, Issy, I give her a rating of between 1 and 10."

"So what," says Issy, "I do the same."

"But my system is different," says Bernard, "I score Jewish women differently to non-Jewish women."

"That’s new to me," says Issy. "So in your system, what’s a Jewish 10?"

"That’s a woman who I would normally rate a ‘4’ but who has £1,000,000."

Abe goes to see Doctor Myers and says, "I want to become a woman."

"You must be joking," says Doctor Myers.

"No I’m not," says Abe, "I’m serious about it. Are you willing to perform the necessary operations on me?"

"No, definitely not," replies Doctor Myers.

"So who will do it?" asks Abe.

"Well I shouldn’t tell you this," replies Doctor Myers, "but I know the name of a doctor in France who can do it."

Six months later, Abe returns to Doctor Myers and says, "I’m so glad you gave me the name of doctor Jean-Pierre. I’ve had it done and I feel terrific. My new name is Sadie and I now function in every way like a woman, emotionally as well as physically."

"But … Sadie," asks Doctor Myers, "don’t you have any emotions or desires left over from your previous life as a man?"

"Well now you ask," replies Sadie, "some mornings I do have this great urge to lay tefillin."

### #1339 Inevitable changes

Little Sam and Melissa are very good friends. They attend the same school, are in the same class and every day without fail follow the same lunch time routine - they sit down together, open their lunch boxes together and both eat their chicken sandwiches (their favourite) together.

Five years later, they’re still following the same routine. But then one day, as Sam is eating his chicken sandwich, he’s shocked to see that Melissa is eating a smoked salmon sandwich. "Missy," says Sam, looking upset, "you’re not eating a chicken sandwich. I thought you said you would only ever eat chicken."

"I still love chicken, Sam," replies Melissa, "but I have to stop eating it."

"Why?" asks Sam.

Melissa points to her lap and replies," Because I’m starting to grow feathers down here."

"I don’t believe it," says Sam, "show me."

"OK," says Melissa and she lifts up her skirt and lowers her panties.

Sam looks very closely and after a few seconds says, "I see them too, Missy, I think you’re right to stop eating chicken."

Their new lunch time routine continues for another 6 months, with Sam eating chicken and Melissa eating smoked salmon. Then one day he brings in a peanut butter sandwich.

"Missy," he says, "I’ve given up chicken. I’m growing feathers down there too."

"Can I see?" asks Melissa.

"OK," says Sam and he pulls down his trousers and pants.

"You’ve left it very late, Sam," she says, "you’ve already started to grow the polkeh (drumstick) and also the matzoh balls for the chicken soup."

"Hello Cyril," says Fred, "I hear you know Hebrew?"

"Yes I do," replies Cyril.

"I was wondering what the Hebrew for ‘he' is?" says Fred.

"Hu," says Cyril.

"No one in particular," says Fred, "I just wanted to know what is he?"

"Hee is she," says Cyril.

"Who?" says Fred.

"No, Hu is he," says Cyril.

"I thought you said he is she?" says Fred.

"Yes, that’s correct," says Cyril.

"What is correct?" says Fred.

"Hee is she," says Cyril.

"I have no idea what you said. Who is she?" says Fred.

"No, Hu is he," says Cyril.

"I don’t want to know who he is, now I want to know what she is in Hebrew?" says Fred.

"Hee," says Cyril.

"He who?" says Fred.

Yes that’s correct, but Hee is she," says Cyril.

"Who is she?" says Fred.

"No, Hu is he," says Cyril.

"Why do you keep asking me who is he?" says Fred.

"I thought you were asking me what he is in Hebrew?" says Cyril.

"Me?" says Fred.

"That’s Hu," says Cyril.

"Who is me?" says Fred.

"No, Hu is he, Mee is who," says Cyril.

"I don't want to know who you are, I want to know who is he?" says Fred.

"That’s correct," says Cyril.

"But you say it so well," says Cyril.

"Who me?" says Fred.

"Why are you asking me who he is?" says Cyril.

"No, I’m asking you what is he?" says Fred.

"Hee is she," says Cyril.

"Who is she?" says Fred.

"No, Hu is he," says Cyril.

"I’m very lost. Me is who? Who is he? He is she?" says Fred.

"Very good, you said that very well," says Cyril.

"What did I say?" says Fred.

"Mee is who, Hu is he and Hee is she," says Cyril.

"Well if you must know, you’re crazy. I don't know who he is and if

she is a he, I’m sure I don't want to know her," says Fred.

### #1344 Dying wishes

Hette is dying and her rabbi comes to visit her. "Do you have any last wishes, Hetty?" asks Rabbi Gold.

"Yes rabbi," whispers Hetty, "I know you won’t like hearing me say this, but I want to be cremated."

"You know that is forbidden to us," says Rabbi Gold, "but because it’s one of your final wishes – then OK. Is there anything else?"

"Yes," whispers Hetty, "I want my ashes spread over the John Lewis department store in Brent Cross."

"Why on earth would you want to do that?" asks Rabbi Gold.

"Because that way," replies Hetty, "my two daughters will find it easy to visit me each week."

### #1345 The after-life

Moshe and Rebecca make a vow that whoever dies first would come back and inform the other of the after-life. Their fear is that there is no after-life.

Many, many years later, Moshe dies and true to his word, he makes contact.

"Rebecca …. Rebecca," he says, "can you hear me?"

"Is that you, Moshe?" asks Rebecca.

"Yes, Becky," he replies, "I've come back, just as we agreed."

"So what's it like, Moshe?" asks Rebecca.

"Well Becky, it’s like this," replies Moshe. "Every morning, I get up and have sex. I have breakfast and then off to the golf course where I have sex. I sunbathe and then have sex twice. I have lunch, another romp around the golf course, then sex all afternoon.  After dinner, it’s the golf course again, then I have sex until late.  It likes this every day."

"Oh Moshe," says Rebecca, "you really must be in heaven."

"Not exactly, Becky," says Moshe, "I'm a rabbit on the Hampstead Garden Suburb golf course."

"Well," replies Maurice, "I asked for my steak to be rare, and it was well done."

"Thank you sir," says the waiter, "we always aim to please."

### #1351 Conversation in a restaurant – part 2

"What would you do if I suddenly died, Maurice?" says Sadie, "Would you marry again?"

"No, Sadie, definitely not," replies Maurice.

"Why ever not?" says Sadie. "Don't you like being married?"

"You know I do," replies Maurice.

"Then why do you say you wouldn't get married again?" asks Sadie.

"OK, Sadie, I was wrong," replies Maurice, trying to end the conversation, "Yes, I would get married again."

Sadie then puts on a sad look and continues his ‘interrogation’. "You really would re-marry?"

Maurice doesn’t answer this but just groans very quietly.

"So would you live with her in … our house?" asks Sadie.

"Why not?" replies Maurice, beginning to enjoy himself, "it’s paid for, there’s no outstanding mortgage."

"And would you take my photos out of our silver frames and replace them with her photos?" asks Sadie.

"Yes, why not," replies Maurice, "that would seem like the correct thing to do."

"And would you sleep with her in our marital bed, where we conceived our children?" asks Sadie.

"So where else do you think we would sleep?" replies Maurice.

"And would she use my golf clubs?" asks Sadie.

"Oh no," replies Maurice, "she's left-handed."

Silence fills the air, then …"Oh, sh*t," says Maurice.

### #1352 Search party

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

60year old Yitzhak and 65year old Hyman are pushing their shopping trolleys around Waitrose supermarket one day when they collide. Hyman immediately says, "Sorry. I was looking for my wife Sadie and I wasn't really paying attention to where I was going. I hope I didn’t hurt you."

"No problem," says Yitzhak, "but what a coincidence. I'm also looking for my wife. I just can't find my Judith anywhere and I'm getting a little worried."

"So let’s help each other," suggests Hyman, "what does your Judith look like?"

Yitzhak replies, "Well, she’s a young 35 year old. She’s got long legs, she’s slim and she has.. how shall I say this?….prominent breasts. She has blonde hair, green eyes and is wearing blue shorts. What does your Sadie look like?"

"It doesn't matter," replies Hyman, "let's just look for your Judith."

### #1353 Lost and found

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Nathan goes to shul (synagogue) one shabbes and Rabbi Bloom almost faints when he sees him - Nathan has never stepped foot inside a shul since his barmitzvah. At the end of the Service, Rabbi Bloom goes over to Nathan and says, "I’m very pleased to see you here today, what made you come?"

Nathan replies, "I'll be honest with you, rabbi. I lost my favourite hat about 3 months ago and I really miss it. A friend of mine told me that Kenneth Gold has a hat just like mine. My friend also told me that Gold comes to shul every shabbes, always takes off his hat before Service begins, leaves it in the cloakroom at the back of the shul and replaces it with his yarmulke. So I was going to leave after the Torah reading and steal Gold’s hat."

Rabbi Bloom says, "Well Nathan, I notice that you didn't steal Gold’s hat after all.  Whilst I’m very glad, please tell me why you changed your mind."

"Well rabbi," replies Nathan, "after I heard your sermon on the Ten Commandments, I decided that I didn't need to steal Gold’s hat."

Rabbi Bloom smiles and says, "I suppose you decided against it after you heard me talking about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal'?"

"Not exactly, rabbi," replies Nathan. "After you talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery,' I remembered where I left my hat."

### #1354 Thanks for nothing

One morning, Shlomo and Sadie decide to go out for breakfast. The waitress at ‘The Walnut Tree’ tells them that the special that morning is two eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, hash browns and toast for £3.99.

"That sounds good," says Sadie, "but I don't want any eggs."

"OK," says the waitress, but I will then have to charge you £4.50."

"Why," asks Shlomo, "it doesn’t make sense."

"Because you will then in effect be ordering a la carte," the waitress replies.

"Do you mean I'll have to pay for not taking the eggs?" Sadie asks.

"Yes," replies the waitress.

"OK then, I'll take the special."

"How do you want your eggs?"

"Raw and in the shell," Sadie replies.

At the end of the meal, Sadie takes the two eggs home.

### #1355 How to get a man

Ruth is Naomi’s only child. Unfortunately Ruth is a rather plain girl and as a result is still single at 30 - she doesn’t even have a boyfriend. So naturally, Naomi is getting worried and sees her chance of becoming a bubbeh fading fast. So one day Naomi decides to have a heart-to-heart talk with Ruth.

"Darling," she says, "I’m your mother and I love you, so please don’t get angry with me when you hear what I have to say.  I’m getting worried about you because you won’t find a nice man by staying at home, night after night, doing nothing but looking sad and watching TV.  Believe me, darling, the best thing to do is to advertise yourself in the Jewish Dating Times."

"Oh mum," says Ruth, embarrassed, "I just couldn’t do that."

"But you could, darling," says Naomi. "You don’t give your name, you just put in a box number where suitors send their details about themselves. And we won’t tell a soul we’re doing it, not even your dad."

After ten further minutes of serious discussion, Naomi gets her way and next day they place the following advert in the paper

### #1356 You’re a …Jewish boy?

Naomi is in love with Peter and takes him home to meet her parents, Moshe and Hetty. "Dad," she says, "I’d like you to meet Peter. We’re in love and we would like to get married."

It soon became obvious to Moshe that Peter wasn’t Jewish. "Now look Peter," says Moshe, "you seem a great person and I can see why my Naomi has fallen for you. But you must understand that we only want Naomi to marry a Jewish boy. Please don’t take it personally - it’s what my wife and I want."

"I fully understand sir," says Peter. "Naomi and I realised this would be the situation and so I’ve told her I’m willing to convert to Judaism. If I did this, would you then give us your blessing?"

Moshe thinks for a while, then replies, "Yes, I would."

Over the following 12 months, Peter gets circumcised (ouch), joins Moshe’s synagogue, goes to Hebrew classes, attends shabbes services and finally takes a 6 week trip to Israel. But when he returns to make arrangements for the wedding, he learns that Naomi has fallen out of love with him. She doesn’t now want to marry him. Peter is devastated and goes to Moshe to see whether he can help.

"Moshe," he says, "I agreed to convert and become a real Jew – and I have. I’ve been circumcised, I’ve regularly attended shabbes services and I can speak Hebrew as well as anyone. I know all the Jewish customs and I can tell wonderful Jewish jokes.  I’m a mensh, but Naomi doesn’t want me. What on earth can I do?"

"Marry a shiksa like all the other Jewish boys," replies Moshe.

"Doctor," she says, "what will the operation to give me a full face lift cost?"

"For you," says the doctor, I would estimate £25,000."

"Oy veh, that’s far too much, doctor," she says. "Isn’t there something less expensive?"

"Well," replies the doctor, "you could try wearing a veil."

### #1358 Moshe’s 3 inventions

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Moshe is an inventor, or at least he thinks he is. After spending many months in his study working on his latest ideas, he rings the Patent Office and books an appointment. When he arrives, the receptionist greets him, "Good morning Mr. Levy. I see you’re booked to meet with one of our consultants to discuss your three new inventions. Before you do so, however, I have to fill in this form. I only need to ask you some basic questions. Is this OK with you?"

"Yes, it’s fine, thank you," replies Moshe.

After asking Moshe the usual questions such as name, address, nationality and age, the receptionist goes on to ask, "And what is your first invention, Mr Levy?"

"I’ve invented a folding bottle," replies Moshe, proudly.

"And do you have a name for it?" she asks.

"Yes, I call it a FOTTLE," replies Moshe.

"And what’s your second invention?" she asks, smiling ever so slightly.

"I’ve invented a folding carton," replies Moshe.

"And what do you call that?" she asks.

"I call it a FARTON," replies Moshe.

At that, she can’t help laughing as she says, "If I may say so, Mr Levy, those are rather silly names for new products. And the name of your carton is a bit rude too."

Moshe is not prepared to take any further ridicule from her and walks out of the office. He doesn’t even tell her about his third invention, his folding bucket.

### #1359 The car sale

Rivkah drives a big Lexus to her local Lexus dealer and tells him she wants to sell it. "How much do you want for it?" he asks her.

"I’ll be happy to accept £100," she replies.

The dealer is very suspicious. Well he would be - the car is almost new and is worth at least £40,000. "I’m not sure I want to take it," he says to Rivkah.

"Don’t get worried," says Rivkah, "let me explain. There’s nothing wrong with the car, as well you know, as you sold it to us only recently. But mine Bernie died two weeks ago and he was having an affair with his shiksa secretary. I’ve just attended the reading of his Will and in it he says his secretary should have the proceeds from selling his car. So here I am."

### #1361 Satisfaction guaranteed

One day, sixty year old twins Joshua and Shlomo are having a chat about their sex lives. Joshua says, "I must be honest with you Shlomo, I just can’t seem to satisfy mine Esther these days. I try hard, but I don’t succeed."

"I don’t have that problem, Joshua," says Shlomo. "Every night, just before mine Sadie and I get into bed, I get totally undressed in front of her and say, ‘Well, take a look. Are you satisfied?’ Sadie just shrugs and replies, ‘yes’.   And that’s it."

### #1362 What money can’t buy

During their business lives, Joel, Mordechai and Emanuel did so well that they became millionaires. Now, in retirement, they meet up in one of the most expensive hotels in the world, the ‘Mazuma Mit Mazel’ Hotel, no less. During their conversation, it soon becomes clear that they all have problems with deteriorating body parts.

"It’s unfair," says Joel. "Now that I have money and I’m a widower, I could go with any of the beautiful women who come here looking for a husband. But because of my poor eyesight, I’m unable to see who’s beautiful and who’s not."

"I know what you mean," says Mordechai. "Now that I have money, I could order anything from the 7 star Michelin restaurant here – lobster, caviar, even the most expensive champagne they sell, Krug's ‘Clos du Mesnil’, but my doctor tells me that I must stick to things such as sardines, water biscuits, spinach and milk. With me it’s my bad stomach."

"I too have a problem," says Emanuel. "Take last night, for example. I’m in bed and feeling frisky so I ask mine Sarah to roll over onto her back. But she says to me, ‘Oh no, not again, you can’t be serious - we just made love for the third time only 10 minutes ago. So you see, guys, with me it’s my memory."

### #1364 Knowledge is a dangerous thing

Peter is a street trader who has set up his pitch right outside the Golders Green synagogue. One day Jed, a friend of Peter and also a trader, happens to walk past the synagogue and sees Peter. "Hey Peter, I hear you’re doing very well here. What’s your secret then?"

"It’s easy," replies Peter, "when one of my clients comes out of the synagogue, I always say something like, ‘good shabbes Mr Levy, how was the kiddush?’ or ‘good yontif Mr Cohen, how was the service today?’"

"But how do you remember all these words?" asks Jed.

"It’s easy," says Peter, pointing to his head, "I keep them right up here in my toches."

### #1365 Lunch appointment

70 year old Sidney opens his eyes and sees a lovely lady in white staring at him. "Where am I?" he says.

"You’re in the Middlesex hospital, Mr Green," she replies. "You had a nasty car crash 4 days ago and you’ve been unconscious ever since you were brought in.  But don’t worry about anything – you’re in a great hospital and we’ve got the best doctor looking after you."

"4 days, eh?" says Sidney, "it’s no wonder I’m so hungry. So bring me a hot salt beef sandwich on rye with mustard and a new green cucumber and some latkes on the side."

"I’m sorry, your doctor has instructed me not to feed you with any solids," says the nurse. "You’re being fed rectally. Do you see that large tube down there? If you follow it, you’ll find it is stuck up your back passage."

"Well then," says Sidney, "If this really is the best hospital with the best equipment, please bring me two more tubes tomorrow. Then I would very much like to invite you and my doctor to join me for lunch."

Aharon asks his friend Monty, "Tell me, Monty, you’re a clever guy. This has been puzzling me for years. Why do we call noodles ‘noodles’?"

"Well," says Monty, "it’s simple, really. They’re soft like noodles, aren’t they? They’re also long like noodles, aren’t they? And they certainly taste like noodles, don’t they? So why shouldn’t we call them noodles?"

One evening, Rabbi Levy is visited by a stranger. "Yes," says the rabbi, "can I help you?"

"Life is very hard for some," says the man. "I thought you should know about the problems facing one of your congregation."

"So tell me already," says the rabbi.

"Well," says the man, "your Mrs Goldman owes a moneylender over £1,000 and she hasn’t got the money to pay him back. She’s being thrown out her house this week, she’s too ill to work and she can’t feed her children."

"It’s a terrible life, indeed," says Rabbi Levy. "Thank you for letting me know. I’ll raise some money from the synagogue straight away – I’ll even donate £100 of my own money.  But tell me, my friend, are you a relative of Mrs Goldman?"

"Don’t be silly, rabbi," says the man, "I’m the moneylender."

### #1388 Mr Grumpy

Moshe and Sadie, both in their seventies, are driving to Birchington-on-sea when they decide to stop at a nice country pub for a bite to eat. After finishing their meal, they get back into their car and continue on their journey. But 15 minutes after leaving, Sadie suddenly says, "Moshe, you’ve got to turn around and go back to the pub. I’ve left my glasses on the table there."

"I don’t believe it," Moshe shouts angrily at her, "you silly moo, you’ll forget your head one day."

Moshe turns the car around and starts driving back to the pub. All the way there, he’s grumpy and makes many snide comments like, "Your memory is getting really bad," and "Because of you, we won’t now be able to get to Birchington in time to see the sunset."  Even though the more he rebukes Sadie, the more agitated he becomes, he doesn’t let up for the entire 15 minute drive back to the pub.

To Sadie’s relief, they finally arrive back at the pub. As she gets out of the car and hurries inside to retrieve her glasses, Moshe yells to her, "And while you're in there, Sadie, you might as well get my hat. I left it in the cloakroom."

### #1390 The sales pitch

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Emanuel was looking for a new job that would best make use of his skills. So one day he tries his hand selling second-hand cars at YINGATSH MOTORS.  Although he has no experience in this field, he is confident that he can succeed. On his first day, he tries to sell cars using the traditional approach by using phrases such as, "This car has only been driven by little old Kitty Cohen to go to Brent Cross shopping centre once a week," and "This car is almost brand new, just like my mum’s Rosh Hashanah hat."

Emanuel uses this approach on every perspective buyer but none believes him and he doesn’t sell a car all day. So next day he changes his sales pitch and sells three cars.

The manager of YINGATSH is so pleased with Emanuel that he calls him into his office and says, "Well done Manny, what did you do to make these sales?"

"Well," replies Emanuel, smiling, "the customers didn't believe my little old lady story so I told them the car was previously owned by Rebecca Love-Gold, a nymphomaniac who only used the back seat."

David leaves London and makes aliyah (emigrates) to Israel. As soon as he settles down in Tel Aviv, he goes to see the local optician.

"I’m having trouble reading," he says, "maybe you could check my eyes?"

The optician agrees and sits David in front of a large eye test chart. "Can you read the letters on the bottom line?" he asks.

"No," replies David.

"So how about the next line up?" asks the optician.

Squinting, David replies, "No, I still can’t read them."

"OK," says the optician, "let’s start at the top line. Read out the letters please."

"But I can’t," says David.

"Are you perhaps a teeny bit blind?" asks the optician.

"Certainly not," replies David, "it’s just that I’ve never learned to read Hebrew."

### #1400 Revenge

Moshe comes home early from work one day and discovers his wife Clare in bed with his neighbour. He’s angry and bitter and feels very humiliated. So he goes over to his friend’s house and says, "I’m going to poison her, Henry."

"I wouldn’t do that, Moshe," says Henry, "the police will quickly discover it’s you and you’ll go to jail for a very long time. Better you should shtup (vulgar for ‘have sex’) her to death. It’ll be over in 12 months, I guarantee."

Moshe takes Henry’s advice and starts to make love to Clare every morning, noon and night without fail. After this has been going on for about a year, Henry goes to visit them.

Clare answers the door and Henry is immediately taken aback by how well she looks. She is literally glowing with health. She takes him into the lounge and there sitting on the sofa is Moshe. And oy veh, does Moshe look bad! His skin is pale, his eyes are sunken in their sockets, he’s lost most of his hair and he’s shaking all over. When Clare goes into the kitchen to make some tea, Henry says to Moshe, "So how come you’re looking so ill and yet Clare seems so well?"

"Shhh," replies Moshe, "don’t talk so loud. She doesn’t know it yet but she’s only got a few more weeks to live."

### #1401 How man was created – alternative version

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

After 4 weeks in the Garden of Eden, God comes to visit Eve. "So Eve, how’s everything going?" inquires God.

"It’s all so beautiful," she replies, "the sunrises and sunsets are breathtaking, the smells, the sights, everything is wonderful. But I have one problem. It’s these breasts you’ve given me, the middle one pushes the other two out and I’m constantly knocking them with my arms, catching them on branches and snagging them on bushes. They’re a real pain. Surely God, since many other parts of my body come in pairs, such as my arms and legs, my ears and my eyes, I feel that having only two breasts will make me more symmetrically balanced."

"That’s a fair point," replies God, "but it was my first shot at this, don’t forget. I gave the animals 6 breasts so I figured that you needed only half of those. But I see that you’re right so I’ll fix it up right away."  And God reaches down, removes Eve’s middle breast and tosses it into the bushes.

Three weeks pass and God once again visits Eve in the Garden of Eden. "Well, Eve, how is my favourite creation?"

"Just fantastic," she replies, "but for one oversight on your part. You see, all the animals are paired off. The ewe has a ram and the cow has her bull. All the animals have a mate except me. I feel so alone."

God thinks for a moment and says, "You know, Eve, you’re right once again. How could I have overlooked this? You do need a mate and I will immediately create MAN from a part of you. Now let's see, where did I put that useless boob?"

### #1404 Conversion procedures

Bernard Levinsky wants to become a British citizen, so he changes his name to Benny Levy and applies for citizenship. After many months of waiting, he’s asked to attend court, answer some questions and become, at last, a full British citizen.

Benny stands up to face judge Hodge. "Mr. Levy," says judge Hodge, "before I can grant you citizenship, I must ask you a few questions to confirm for myself that you really are interested in the UK, its government and its rulers. Do you understand?"

"Yes," replies Benny.

"All right, who are the UK’s leading political parties?" asks judge Hodge.

"I’m a diamond merchant," replies Benny, "do I have time to worry about political parties?"

"Then who is our current Prime Minister?" asks judge Hodge.

"That’s simple," replies Benny, "doesn’t everyone know the answer?"

"Mr Levy," says judge Hodge, "are you always in a habit of answering questions in such an ambiguous manner?"

"Why shouldn’t I?" replies Benny.

Judge Hodge is now getting angry. "Mr Levy," he shouts, "are you willing to swear your allegiance to our Queen, to our future King Charles and to everyone else in the Royal Family?"

"Your honour," replies Benny, "do you really want me to swear in court?"

"Mr Levy," shouts judge Hodge, "please stop answering all my questions with a question. Do you promise to support the Prime Minister and his government?"

"Isn’t it enough that I support mine Sarah and my three darling kinder (children)," replies Benny. "You want my blood as well?"

"My dear Abe," replies Rabbi Bloom, "you are unfortunately misreading the situation. She is not my reward, I am her punishment."

together somewhere other than the synagogue!"

His grandfather stares into the distance then turns to Daniel and replies, "Well, last week I sat out here with no shirt on and I got a stiff neck. This is your bubbeh's idea."

After they leave, Moshe thinks about what Solly has said and although he doesn’t really believe it, he decides it wouldn’t hurt to try it out. So he goes to the Edgware Grodzinskis bakery and says to the lady behind the counter, "I’ll take a large loaf of your rye bread, please."

"Do you want it sliced?" she asks.

"What's the difference?" replies Moshe.

"Well," she says, "when it’s sliced, it gets hard quicker."

Moshe cries out aloud, "How come everybody knows about this but me?"

"OK, dad," says Sam.

Sam finds his mother and asks, "Mum, would you sleep with Robert Redford for one million pounds?"

She replies, "Absolutely, Sam, how could I miss such an opportunity?"

Sam then goes to his older sister and asks, "Sis, would you sleep with Brad Pitt for one million pounds?"

His sister replies dreamily, "Oh Sam, of course I would, just give me the chance, that’s all I ask."

Over the next few days, Sam thinks a lot about what his mother and sister have said. Then he goes back to his father.

"So Sam," asks his father, "did you find out the difference between potentially and realistically?"

Sam replies, "Yes dad, I learned that potentially we're sitting on 2 million pounds, but realistically we're living with two Koorveh."

"That's my boy," says his father.

### #1420 Bragging

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

New Zealand’s Prime Minister is rudely awoken at 4am by the telephone. "PM, it’s the health minister here. Sorry to bother you at this hour but we have an emergency. I've just been told that the Durex factory in Auckland has burned to the ground and it’s estimated that the entire New Zealand supply of condoms will be gone by the end of the week."

"Oh dear," says the Prime Minister, "the economy will never be able to cope with all those unwanted babies - we'll be ruined! We're going to have to ship some in from abroad... how about the UK?"

"No chance," replies the health minister, "the Poms would have a field day on this one."

"What about Australia?" asks the Prime Minister.

"Maybe - but we don't want them to know that we’re in a mess. Why don't you call Ariel Sharon of Israel and tell him we need one million condoms. Tell him they should be ten inches long and eight inches thick. That way he’ll know how big we Kiwis really are."

So the Prime Minister calls Sharon who agrees to help the Kiwis out in their hour of need in return for improved diplomatic relations. Three days later an air express van arrives in Auckland - full of boxes. A delighted Prime Minister rushes out, opens one of the boxes and finds what was ordered - condoms 10 inches long and 8 inches thick. But they are all coloured blue and white and then the Prime Minister notices, in small writing on each and every one, “MADE IN ISRAEL: SIZE = MEDIUM.”

### #1421 The big escape

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Sarah, Rebecca and Sadie work in the same Golders Green accounts office and every day they notice their tough and demanding boss Kitty leaving work early. So they decide that when Kitty next leaves early, they would leave right after her. After all, she never phones them or returns to work later on, so how would she know they left early? That afternoon, Kitty leaves early again and within 5 minutes, so do Sarah, Rebecca and Sadie.

Sarah is thrilled to get home early. She does some gardening, plays with her son and goes to bed early.

Rebecca is elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the gym before going out on a dinner date.

Sadie is happy to get home early because she wants to surprise her husband. But when she gets to her bedroom door, she hears muffled noises from inside. She opens the door quietly and is shocked to see her husband in bed with her boss Kitty. Gently, Sadie closes the door and creeps out the house.

Next day, during their coffee break, Sarah and Rebecca agree to leave early again and ask Sadie if she is going to leave with them.

"No way," says Sadie, "I almost got caught by Kitty yesterday and I don’t want to take another chance."

"Madam, that dress over there is £599," he replies.

"Oy veh," says Naomi, "I could get the same dress at Minky’s Shmatters in Hendon for only £50."

So at 6am next morning, Leah wakes up and goes to work. She doesn’t return until 1am next morning. Sam notices that she is tired looking, dirty and dishevelled - a complete wreck, in fact.

"Well Leah, how did you do?" asks Sam.

"I made £22.50," she replies.

"So tell me already," asks Sam, "who gave you the 50p?"

"Everyone gave me 50p," Leah answers.

### #1430 A marketing decision

Mordechai and his wife Ruth go to Peeler’s Kosher Restaurant in Manchester and order steak and chips. They are served with fantastically tasty, giant sirloin steaks which they think are the best they’ve had for years. They are so excited about their meal that they tell their friends Abe and Rifka about it.

Abe doesn’t believe any meal could be that good, so all four decide to go to Peeler’s next weekend to check it out.

When they get there, they all order sirloin steak and chips. However, much to their disappointment, the waiter brings them very small steaks. Mordechai asks to see the manager.

"I’m very upset with our meals," he says to the manager. "My wife and I were in this restaurant only last week and you served us big juicy steaks. Today, however, just when I've bought my best friends with us, you serve us such small ones."

"Yes, sir, I know," replies the manager.  "But last week you were sitting by the

window."

### #1436 A betting man

Abe is reading his Jewish Chronicle when his wife Ruth walks up behind him and smacks him on the back of the head with her hand.

"You’ve got it all wrong, darling," Abe says. "Don’t you remember last week when I went to Ascot races? Well, 'Judith Pasha' was the name of one of the horses I bet on whilst I was there."

Ruth gives a shrug and walks away muttering to herself.

A few days later, Abe is reading his Times newspaper when Ruth again walks up behind him and smacks him on the back of the head, but this time much harder.

"What was that for?" Abe shouts, rubbing the back of his head.

They get to her house and make mad passionate love all afternoon. Then, totally exhausted, they fall asleep and don’t wake up until 7pm.

"Oy veh," shouts Moshe, jumping out of her bed, "just look at the time."

As he’s getting dressed, Moshe tells Mary to take his shoes into the garden and rub them thoroughly into the wet mud and grass. She does what she’s told even though she doesn’t know why. Moshe finishes dressing, puts on his shoes and drives home.

As soon as he opens his front door, there’s his wife Rifka waiting for him. "So, where have you been?" demands Rifka, angrily.

"Darling, I can't lie to you," replies Moshe. "I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been making love all afternoon. Then I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 7 o’clock."

Rifka takes one look at his shoes and says, "You lying momzer. You've been playing golf again."

### #1438 The record breaker

Maurice the mortician is working late one night when they bring him the body of a Mr Schwartz to examine. Schwartz is to be buried early the next day. As he examines the body, Maurice can’t help but notice that Schwartz has the biggest shlong he’s ever seen.

"I'm sorry, Schwartz," says Maurice, as he carefully removes the organ with his scalpel, "but I can't send your ‘pride and joy’ to be buried with you. This piece of flesh needs to be saved for posterity." He then stuffs it into his briefcase and takes it home with him.

The first person he shows it to is his wife. "Darling," he says, "I’ve got something to show you that you won’t believe." He then opens up his briefcase.

"Oy veh zmir," she cries out, with tears running down her face, "Schwartz is dead."

### #1439 The convert

Even though Mordechai has been a frummer for over 50 years, one morning, immediately he awakes, he realises he’s fed up with all the strict observances to Jewish law. So he turns to his wife and says, "Bracha, darling, I've had enough of getting up early every morning to put on my tefillin and say the same prayers. I've made a decision – I’ve decided to convert to Catholicism."

"Don’t be so stupid, Mordechai." says Bracha.

But Mordechai won’t be swayed by his wife’s arguments. He gets dressed, leaves the house and asks a passer-by for directions to the nearest church. When he gets there, he discusses his intentions with the priest. The following day, he begins taking instruction and on the day after that he’s baptized into the Catholic faith.

It’s now Thursday morning. Mordechai awakes early as usual and without thinking, puts on his tefillin and starts reciting his morning prayers.

"What are you doing, Mordechai?" asks Esther. "I thought you became a Catholic to avoid ever having to do this again."

"Oy veh," cries Mordechai, smacking himself on the middle of his forehead with the palm of his hand, "goyisher kop!"

### #1440 Is that you?

Becky is making love to her ‘toy boy’ when she hears her Bernie’s car coming up the drive. "Hurry," she says to him, "stand in the corner, my husband’s here." Becky quickly rubs baby oil all over him and dusts him with a thick layer of talcum powder. "Don't move until I tell you to," she whispers to him, "pretend you're a statue."

"What's this, darling?" says Bernie as he enters the bedroom.

"Oh, it's just a statue," replies Becky. "The Golds next door bought one for their bedroom and when I saw it, I liked it so much, I got one for us too."

Nothing more was said, not even when they later go to bed for the night.

At 2am, Bernie quietly slips out of bed, goes down to the kitchen and returns with a cold salt beef sandwich on rye and a glass of orange juice. "Here," he whispers to the statue, "eat this. I stood like a shmuck at the Golds for 2 days and nobody even offered me a glass of water."

"1p?" exclaims Sam, "that’s really cheap."

Then Sam quickly looks through the menu and says, "I’d like a big plate of your best Salt Beef with latkes, haimisher cucumbers and English mustard."

"Certainly," replies the barman, "but that’s going to cost you real money."

"So how much is real money?" asks Sam.

"5p," replies the waiter.

"5p?" says Sam, "that’s ridiculous. You’ll loose money on this. I’d like to talk to the owner. Where is he?"

"He’s upstairs with my wife," replies the waiter.

"What's he doing upstairs with your wife?" asks Sam.

"The same thing as I'm doing to his business," replies the waiter.

Benjy says, "When I grow up I want to be a koorveh."

"Why do you want to be that?" the other two ask.

### #1449 The instructor

Joel and Sarah are soon getting married but are so ‘innocent’ that neither knows what to do on their wedding night. So they agree to see the wise Rabbi Levy for advice. After they explain their predicament, Rabbi Levy takes them up to his bedroom and says, "It’s easier to show you what to do than to explain. Sarah, could you please get undressed and lie down on my bed. I’ll then show you what to do."

Sarah does what she’s told and Rabbi Levy then begins to show them, personally and in great detail, all the steps involved in making love on their first night. When he finishes, he gets off the bed and says to Joel, "Now take Sarah home and practice what I have just shown you."

But Sarah interrupts. With her face all flushed, she says, "Wait a minute Rabbi, please show Joel again what to do.... he’s a little forgetful."

As they’re walking around the city, Becky points out Minky’s Stores. "See that department store? We own it, Harry. And see that apartment building on the opposite corner? Well we own that too."

Walking down a little further they come to a photographic centre and again Becky points to the buildings and says, "We also own all of those. And like the other buildings, not a penny is owed on them."

By now Harry is very confused, so he stops and says to Becky, "You say we own free and clear the department store, the apartment building and the photographic centre. So tell me, how did you get them?"

"Well Harry, you’ll remember that when we got married, from the first shtup onwards, I always made you put some money in my savings account. After 25 years of doing this - and you’re a great lover, don’t forget, with insatiable demands, …..well, that’s how I got the buildings."

The waiter clears his throat and asks, "Ahem, excuse me for asking, sir, but is there a problem with the menu?"

"No there isn’t," Issy replies. "It’s just that my wife Betty usually tells me what I am allowed to eat, and she’s not here."

"That's no problem," says the waiter, "the soup of the day is chicken soup with lokshen and to make it real tasty we add giblets and chicken fat. But…. I’m sure your wife would want you to have the tomato juice."

The waiter then continues. "Today’s special is potted flanken nosh-up. This is made with especially fatty meat to which we add potatoes and carrots and leave the whole caboodle in the oven for almost eight hours. We then serve it with home made challah bread for dipping into the gravy. But….. I’m sure your wife would want you to have the boiled chicken wings and rice."

On hearing this, Issy puts down the menu and says, "Nag nag, nag. That's all Betty ever does. I'm tired of her telling me what to do. I'll have the chicken soup and flanken nosh-up."

Dr Myers has been looking after one of his patients, 80-year-old Freda, for most of her life. But he retires and passes all his patients over to the newly qualified Dr Faith who has just joined the practice.  One of the first things Dr Faith does is to ask to see Freda and she should bring with her a list of all the medicines that have been prescribed for her. Eventually, Freda has her appointment.

As Dr Faith is looking through Freda’s list, he is totally shocked to see that she has a prescription for birth control pills.

"Mrs Cohen," he says, "do you realise that these are birth control pills?"

"Yes doctor," replies Freda, "they help me sleep at night."

"Mrs Cohen," says Dr Faith, "I can assure you that there is absolutely nothing in birth control pills that could possibly help you sleep better at night."

When she hears this, Freda reaches over to Dr Faith, lovingly pats him on his knee and says, "Yes, doctor, I know this, but every morning I get up very early, grind up one of the pills and mix it in the glass of orange juice that my 16 year old granddaughter Suzy drinks when she awakes. Believe me doctor, this helps me sleep at night."

On this particular shabbes, he decides to use squirrels for an object lesson on teaching them the need for industry and preparation. So he starts out by saying to the children, "I'm now going to describe something to you and I want you to raise your hand when you know what it is."

The children nod eagerly.

"This thing runs around in trees (pause)… and eats nuts (pause)..."

No hands go up.

"And it’s grey or brown (pause)… and it has a bushy tail (pause)…"

The children look at each other, but still no hands are raised.

"And it takes big jumps from one branch to another (pause)… and it chatters and flips its tail when it's excited (pause)…"

Finally, little Sam tentatively raises his hand. Rabbi Levy breathes a sigh of relief and says, "Good, Sam, so what do you think it is?"

"Well, rabbi," says little Sam, "I know the answer must be Moses … but it sounds just like a squirrel to me!"

All the patients in the waiting room turn to look at Harry, who is by now very embarrassed. However, he quickly gathers himself together and in an equally loud voice replies, "No, you’re wrong. I've come to inquire about the possibility of a sex change operation, but now I’ve seen you, I don't want the same doctor that did yours."

Ruth's baby boy is born with only one eyelid. "Oy veh! What am I going to do?" she says to her doctor.

"Don't worry," he replies, "after the bris, we will take the little bit of skin from down there and make him a nice new eyelid."

"But if you do that," says Ruth, "won’t it will make him cockeyed?"

"On the contrary," says the doctor, "it will give him good foresight."

### #1497 Birthday wishes

Bennie wakes up one morning with a smile on his face – because today he is 90 years old. He gets out of bed, looks down at his toes and says, "Hello toes, how are you today?  Did you know that you’re now 90? Oh, the times we used to have together. Do you remember when we used to take a walk in the park every Sunday afternoon? Or the weekends we rock-and-rolled on the dance floor with all the young ladies? So, happy birthday toes."

Bennie then looks down at his knees and says, "Hello knees, how are you today? Did you know that you’re now 90? Oh, the times we used to have together. Do you remember when we always used to march in all the parades we could find? Or all the Israeli dancing we used to do with all the beautiful ladies in Roberto’s class? So, happy birthday knees."

Benny then looks down at his crotch and says, "Hello Willie, you little traitor. If you were alive today, you'd be 90 years old."

### #1502 Not on a kibbutz

Aharon, Bracha and their son Mordechai have lived an extremely isolated life in a kibbutz without any form of modern convenience. There is no TV, no radio, no PC - in fact there is no electricity. And not one of them has ever left the kibbutz since they were born. But when Aharon reaches 50 years of age, they decide to take their very first overseas trip to London. Today, they are visiting a shopping mall.

While Aharon is inside an electronics shop being amazed by the variety of equipment on display, Bracha and Mordechai are outside the shop, being fascinated by two shiny, silver walls that move apart by magic and then slide back together again. "What are those, mother?" asks Mordechai.

Bracha replies, "Son, I have never seen anything like them in my life. I just don’t know what they are."

Suddenly, an obese elderly man with white hair, thick glasses and a walking stick hobbles over to the silver walls and presses a button. The walls open, he walks between the doors into a small room, and the walls close behind him.  Bracha and Mordechai then see some small numbers above the walls light up and change sequentially from 1 to 6. Then they notice the numbers start changing, this time from 6 down to 1. The walls open up again and a very handsome young man steps out. Bracha watches him walk away and, not taking her eyes off him, says quietly to Mordechai, "Son, go get your father."

### #1503 GABS

Moshe returns to Israel following a trip to China and is feeling very ill. When his doctor examines him, Moshe is rushed to hospital for tests and then placed in a private room in the isolation ward to await the results. Moshe has been there no more than a few hours when the phone by Moshe’s bed rings.

"This is your doctor speaking," says the voice on the phone, "I now have the results of your tests and I'm sorry to have to tell you that you have an extremely contagious disease known as GABS. I can't see you in person – in fact no one can. That’s why I’m using the phone."

"GABS?" gasps Moshe, "What is that. What does it mean?"

"Well," says his doctor, GABS is a disease combining Gonorrhoea, AIDS, Bird Flu and Syphilis It can be deadly if not treated quickly."

"Oy veh, doctor," screams Moshe, "how are you going to treat me?"

"Well, we're going to keep you in isolation and put you on a strict diet of slices of worsht, fried egg, matzo and kichels." says the doctor.

"Will they cure me?" asks Moshe.

"Not really," replies the doctor, "but those are the only foods we can slide under the door."

A plane was flying from Seattle to San Francisco. The plane stopped in Sacramento along the way and the flight attendant explained, "I’m sorry, folks, but there’s going to be a short delay. If you want to get off the aircraft to stretch their legs, the plane will be re-boarding in 45 minutes."

Everybody got off the plane except one blind man. His Seeing-Eye dog lay quietly in front of him. The pilot approached him and said, "We're going to be in Sacramento for almost an hour. Would you like help to get off and stretch your legs?"

The blind man replied, "No thanks, but my dog would like to stretch his legs."

All the people in the gate area were shocked when they saw the pilot walk off the plane with a Seeing-Eye dog. The pilot was even wearing dark sunglasses. People scattered. They not only tried to change planes, but they were trying to change airlines!

### #1506 The secret message

Benny has been having an affair with Gina, his Italian secretary, for several years. One night, during one of their clandestine ‘meetings’, Gina shocks him by telling him that she is pregnant and that he is the father. Not wanting to ruin his marriage, Benny says, "I’ve done very well in business, as you know, and I’m prepared to pay you a large sum of money if you’ll go to Italy to secretly have your baby. Further, if you’ll stay in Italy to raise the baby, I’ll also provide generous child support until the baby turns 18. What do you say?"

Gina thinks for a while then replies, "OK Benny. You’re an honest man and I trust you. I’ll move back to Italy and live with my parents. But how will you know when the baby is born?"

"To keep it discreet," he tells her, "simply send me a postcard with the word SPAGHETTI written on the back. I’ll then immediately arrange for child support payments to begin."

One day, about 9 months later, Benny comes home to his confused wife. "Darling," she says, "you received a very strange postcard today."

"OK, let me see it," he says.

His wife hands him the postcard and as she watches him read the card, he turns white and faints.

Written on the card was: -

### #1507 True story Number 1

[My thanks to Anna R for sending me this true story]

In case you thought that chutzpah was a Jewish characteristic, here is one of my favourite examples of it, from a man who lives locally.

In New Zealand, koi carp are a pest. They foul waterways, eat smaller fish, grow big and fat and make nuisances of themselves. People spend a lot of time, energy and money getting rid of them. Not so a local farmer. He organises an annual event where people pay HIM to come and hunt his kois, and there are prizes for the ones who catch the most! Eager fishers/hunters flock in and pay good money to keep his koi numbers down.

Now, that's chutzpah.

### #1508 True story Number 2

[My thanks to Richard K for sending me this true story]

Dear David, among other things, I’m a book-seller on the streets of New York, 85th & Broadway to be precise. So I meet a lot of people on the Upper West Side.  One elderly Jewish man I met was telling me that he grew up as a kid in Brooklyn and spoke Yiddish at home. There was a funeral parlour nearby with the name, I.G. Morris. When his mother would get angry or annoyed at someone, she would say, "Lozz-im gehn' auf I.G. Morris!" (Let'm go to I.G. Morris!) This cracked me up for several days! So although it is not a joke, you can easily picture this scene.

### #1511 What are friends for?

Ruth has just been to see her doctor for the first time in years and returns home with a little plastic beaker.  When her husband Henry sees the beaker, he asks Ruth, "So nu, darling, what’s the beaker for?"

"Doctor Myers wants me to bring him a specimen in it."

"So provide him with one already," says Henry.

"Well I would if I could," says Ruth, "but what’s a specimen, darling?"

"How the hell should I know," replies Henry, "we haven’t seen a medical person for years. Why don’t you ask your friend Rifka - she’s always going to see her doctor."

So Ruth goes out to talk to Rifka. She returns 30 minutes later. Her dress is torn and she has two black eyes and a cut lip.

"What on earth has happened to you," Henry asks.

"You wouldn’t believe it," she replies, "When I asked Rifka what a specimen was, she said, ‘go pee in a bottle.’ So I told her to ‘gay kakken af en yam’ and that’s when the fight started.

[My thanks to Moshe for the following]

"For the first two weeks," says the dietician, "I want you to eat normal, then skip one day and start all over again. If you do this, I guarantee you will lose at least 14 pounds in the first two weeks."

Two weeks pass and Abe goes back to the dietician and gets onto the scales. The dietician is stunned. "Abe, you’ve lost 20 pounds. This is unbelievable.  Did you follow my instructions?"

"Yes I did," replies Abe, "I followed your instructions explicitly, even though I nearly died on day 6."

"Do you mean die, as in ‘hunger’?" asks the dietician.

"No," replies Abe, "I mean die, as in ‘all the skipping.’"

### #1513 The Passover test

[My thanks to Jeff G for the following]

Sean is waiting for a bus when another man joins him at the bus stop. After 20 minutes of waiting, Sean is hungry so he takes a sandwich from his lunch box and starts to eat. But noticing the other man watching, Sean asks, "Would you like one? My wife has made me plenty."

"Thank you very much, but I must decline your kind offer," says the other man, "I’m Rabbi Levy."

"Nice to meet you, Rabbi," says Sean, "but my sandwiches are alright for you to eat. They only contain cheese. There’s no meat in them."

"It’s very kind of you," says Rabbi Levy, "but today we Jews are celebrating Passover. It would be a great sin to eat a sandwich because during the 8 days of Passover, we cannot eat bread. In fact it would be a great sin – comparable to the sin of adultery."

"OK," says Sean, "but it’s difficult for me to understand the significance of what you’ve just said."

Many weeks later, Sean and Rabbi Levy meet again. Sean says, "Do you remember, Rabbi, that we met recently and that I’d offered you a sandwich which you refused because you said eating bread on Passover would be as great a sin as that of adultery?"

Rabbi Levy replies, "Yes I remember saying that."

"Well, Rabbi," says Sean, "that day, I went over to my mistress’s apartment and told her what you said. We then tried out both the sins, but I must admit, we just couldn’t see the comparison."

Thinking it's his lucky day, Issy does as he’s told and makes love to Rose. When it’s over, Issy asks, "Darling, why did you want to make love at this very moment? You’ve never wanted to do that before."

"Because I’m making you eggs and the egg timer's broken," Rose replies.

Leah goes to Dr Myers for her yearly examination. He begins by putting her on the scales. "How much do you think you weigh, Leah?" he asks.

"8 stone 5 pounds," Leah replies.

But Dr Myers tells her that her weight is actually 9 stone 3 pounds.

Dr Myers then asks, "How tall are you, Leah?"

### #1519 Up on the roof

Daniel and Howard are brothers and both live in Hampstead. But there the comparison ends – Daniel lives with and looks after their elderly mother and Howard lives with his cat Peachy.

Howard is besotted by Peachy. His whole life is based around her. So when his boss tells him at short notice that he must go to New York to sort out a problem there, he doesn’t know what to do. He can’t take Peachy with him, he can’t leave her behind on her own and he can’t refuse to go to New York. He eventually decides to trust Daniel with Peachy while he’s away. So just before he leaves, Howard goes round to Daniel and explains in great detail what to do. He hands over the cat plus 1 week’s worth of cat medicine and top grade cat food, says goodbye to Peachy and then leaves.

The phone calls begin as soon as he arrives in New York. Howard phones Daniel morning, noon and night to make sure Peachy is alright.  But on the 4th day, when he calls and asks how Peachy is getting along, Daniel replies, "I’m afraid Peachy is dead, Howard."

Howard is immediately besotted with grief. In between his sobs, he says, "That was most cruel, Daniel. You know how much I loved Peachy. Why couldn't you have broken it to me gently?"

"How could I have done that?" asks Daniel.

"Well," says Howard, "when I called, you could have said, ‘well she's OK but she’s up on the roof.’ Then, when I called the next time, you could have said, ‘she fell off the roof and she's at the vets.’  And then, the next time, you could have said, ‘I’m sorry, but she passed away peacefully.’  At least then I would have been a little prepared for the bad news."

"Yes, you’re right, I’m so sorry," says Daniel.

Howard then asks, "By the way, how's mum?"

"She’s ….. OK," replies Daniel, "she's up on the roof fixing a tile."

"I know this, thank you," replies Faye, "but there’s not much I can do - I need both my hands to hold onto my hat."

"Look, lady," says Daniel, "I’m sorry if this embarrasses you, but you’re not wearing any underwear and your… ahem… private parts are exposed."

Faye looks down for a few seconds, then looks up at Daniel and says, "Thanks for pointing this out, but everything you see down there is 80 years old whereas I only bought this hat last week."

[My thanks to my daughter Suzy for the following]

After 15 years of marriage, it’s got to the stage where Victor and Rivkah have no choice but to book an appointment to see Levy, the well known marriage guidance counsellor. When they arrive, Levy asks them to explain their problem. Rivkah immediately launches into a seemingly never-ending tirade, going on and on about Victor’s selfishness, his lying, his bullying, his controlling, his spending money on worthless goods, his never saying anything nice about her, their arguments, his lack of love for her…….but Levy has heard enough, already. He gets up, goes over to Rivkah, pulls her from her chair, embraces her and kisses her passionately on the lips. That stops her in her tracks. Levy then rips off her clothes and makes love to her on his desk. When it’s over, Rivkah sits back down in her chair with a dazed, but very satisfied look on her face.

Levy turns to Victor and says, "You see? That’s what your wife needs, and she needs it at least three times a week. Do you think you can do that?"

Victor thinks for a moment, then replies, "Well, I can certainly get her here on Monday and Thursday, doctor, but on Friday I play golf."

"Oh, I understand," says Morris. "A normal person would use the bucket because it's bigger than the spoon or the teacup."

"Actually," says the Director, "A normal person would just pull the plug. So tell me Morris, do you want a room with an East view or a West view?"

"Of course," says Morris.

So Moshe takes out his note book and starts to make notes.

"It’s like an ordinary jacket," says Morris "but this one has no collar. Neither does it have a lining … or buttons … or button holes.  It doesn’t even have lapels."

"Is that it?" asks Moshe.

"Yes," replies Morris. "So nu? How much will such a jacket cost?"

"For you," replies Moshe, "such a jacket will cost £350."

"But your sign outside says, JACKETS – SPECIAL PRICE - £250," says Morris.

### #1543 The error in the paper

Hymie and Bernie, both in their 90s, live in a retirement home in Edgware. One Friday, Hymie gets up very early, extracts the Jewish Chronicle newspaper from under his door, and goes down to the lounge to read it. He opens the paper, turns to the obituaries page and gets the shock of his life. There, on page 43, is his own obituary!  Even though he quickly realises that it’s an error, it both excites him and upsets him. He has to tell someone, so he goes to reception and uses the internal phone to call Bernie’s room.

After the phone has been ringing for nearly a minute, Bernie finally picks it up and says, sleepily, "Which meshuggeneh is ringing me so early, already?"

"Bernie, are you up yet?" shouts Hymie, excitedly.

"Well I am now, aren’t I?" replies Bernie.

"Bernie," shouts Hymie, "go pick up your Jewish Chronicle and turn to page 43."

"Why, what’s so important in the paper that I should do this?" asks Bernie.

"Bernie, don’t argue with me. Go get the paper and turn to page 43 and do it now," shouts Hymie.

"OK, I've got the paper already," says Bernie, "so what am I looking for?"

"Bernie, turn to page 43 and look at the bottom of column 4," shouts Hymie.

"Alright, already," says Bernie, "I'll start reading the column if you stop yelling at me."

"OK," says Hymie, "but read it now."

The paper rustles for a few seconds, then, following a long silence, Bernie gets back on the phone and quietly asks, "Hymie, so where are you calling me from right now?"

### #1544 The company to work for

[My thanks to Jack L for the following]

Benny is on his way to Tenerife for a 2 weeks holiday. As he’s waiting in the departure lounge at Heathrow airport, a gorgeous woman walks over and sits down next to him.  Benny is convinced that she must be an airline stewardess. However, because she’s not in uniform, he doesn’t know which airline. So he attempts to find out without asking her directly.

He turns to her and chants aloud the Delta Airlines slogan, "Love to fly and it shows?"

She just stares at him in a confused kind of way, so he’s sure she doesn’t work for Delta Airlines.

He turns to her again and this time chants aloud the Singapore Airlines slogan, "Something special in the air?"

Once again she gives him the same confused look, so he’s sure she doesn’t work for Singapore Airlines.

Benny then turns to her for a third time and chants aloud the Thai Airways slogan, "Smooth as Silk?"

At this, the woman gets very, very angry. With a snarl on her face she turns to Benny and shouts, "What the hell do you want?"

Suddenly, all is clear to Benny - he knows who she works for. He slumps back in his chair and says, "Ah, so you work for El Al."

### #1545 Endearing terms

It’s Daniel and Rivkah’s 50th wedding anniversary (mazeltov) and to celebrate, their son Aaron invites the close family to a Golden Wedding dinner at his house. During the evening, Aaron gets very emotional every time he hears his dad call his mum by such endearing terms as ‘darling’, ‘petal’, ‘sweetheart’ and ‘my lover.’ It’s clear to Aaron that his parents are still very much in love. While Rivkah is out the room, Aaron goes over to his father, kisses him and quietly says, "Dad, I’m so pleased for you both. I think it's fantastic that after 50 years you’re still calling mum by those loving pet names."

But Daniel, looking very embarrassed, says, "Things are not always what they seem to be, son. I must tell you the truth - I forgot your mother’s name about 5 years ago."

"No, I didn't hear about Hymie Himmelfarb," says Jeremy. "So what happened to Hymie?"

"He died yesterday," replies Nathan.

"Oy vey! And he was such a healthy man," says Jeremy.

Kitty says, "I’m going to leave the choice of colours, material and design entirely to you. I only ask that whatever you choose, it must be extraordinary."

[My thanks to Freda H for the following]

He’s wearing his kippa, his tzitzit is showing, he has a siddur and tallis bag under one arm and a tefillin bag under the other.

So Moshe asks, "Oy veh Shlomo, where are you going all dressed up like that? It’s not shabbes you know."

"Sssshhh," replies Shlomo, "I don’t want anyone to know, but as I’ve never been to a brothel before, I thought I’d go to Soho and try one out."

"OK, but what’s with your shabbes gear and prayer tools?"

"Well," replies Shlomo, "if I like it there, I might decide to stay over the weekend."

### #1549 And the winner is…

Whenever Freda goes shopping, she carefully scrutinizes everything she buys and always battles to get the best deals. Today is the turn of the local delicatessen. As soon as she enters the shop, she looks around and puts a few items in her trolley. Then she goes over to the cash desk and says to the owner, "I don't like the look of this whitefish of yours."

"Lady," says the owner, "if you’re buying for looks, then don't buy whitefish. Buy goldfish instead."

"Clever doesn’t suit you," she replies sarcastically, "but I’ll take it."

Then pointing to the chicken in her basket, she says, "And what about this here chicken, it has a broken leg."

"Look lady," says the owner, "do you want to eat it or dance with it?"

"Ha Ha, very funny you’re not," says Freda. "OK. But before you weigh the chicken, I want you to take out the bones."

"Listen lady," says the owner, "Because I buy with bones, you'll buy with bones."

"But I never pay for chicken with bones," says Freda.

"OK," says the owner, "no bones, then," as he starts removing the bones.

"Thank you," says Freda smiling, "you’re a mensh. Now put the bones in a separate bag for soup. Oh…and never mind the flesh - I don't like your chicken anyway."

### #1550 Fitness counts

Jed and Solly, both in their 50s, have been working in the same office for many years and have become close friends. One Monday, despite his age, Jed boasts to Solly about his sexual endurance the night before.

"I did it three times with my wife last night Solly," says Jed, matter-of-factly.

"Oy yoy yoy! Three times," gasps Solly admiringly. "How on earth did you manage that?"

"It wasn’t too difficult," replies Jed, modestly. "After my wife and I made love for the first time, I took a 10 minute nap. Then I made love to her again, followed by another 10 minute nap. And then we made love for the third time. I can’t describe how I feel, Solly. I woke up this morning feeling like a stallion."

"What a good method," says Solly, "I must try it. Mine Sadie won't believe what’s happening to her when I manage to shtup her 3 times in one night. It will be a mekheiyeh for both of us."

So that night Solly surprises Sadie. He makes love to her, then takes a 10 minute nap, makes love to her again, takes another nap, this time for 15 minutes and then makes love to her for a third time. Then, with a smile on his face, he rolls over and falls fast asleep.

Solly wakes up feeling absolutely marvellous. He gets dressed and leaves for work. Rather than get on his usual bus, he takes a leisurely stroll to his office. This makes him 30 minutes late. When he arrives, his boss is waiting for him.

"What's the matter Mr Jones?" he asks, "I've been working for you for nearly 25 years and I’ve never once been late. Surely you’re not going to reprimand me for a measly thirty minutes?"

"What do you mean thirty minutes?" says Mr Jones, "where were you yesterday?"

"No I don’t," he replies.

"Are you joking?" says Hannah, "Are you really saying you don’t remember me?"

"Madam," he replies, "I’ve never seen you before.

"Oy veh, you’re going to be so embarrassed when I tell you who I am," says Hannah.

"OK," he says, "why do you think you know me?"

"Because I went to your barmitzvah, that’s why," replies Hannah.

"You’ve made a mistake then," he says, "because I’m not even Jewish."

"You’re not Jewish?" says Hannah, "then please give me back my present."

The first man to arrive and greet Rabbi Levy is a total stranger to him. "Thanks for coming," says the rabbi, "but you must have misunderstood my announcement. This is a meeting of the Board."

"Yes I know," says the man, "but if there’s anyone here more bored than I am, then I'd like to shake his hand."

"Do you have any proof that he owes you the money?" asks the solicitor.

"No, I’m afraid I don’t," replies Cyril.

"OK then," says the solicitor, "Here’s what you should do. Write him a formal letter asking him to pay the £1,000 he owes you."

"But he only owes me £750," says Cyril.

"Exactly right," says the solicitor, "That's what he will say in his reply to you and then we will then have the proof we need to pursue your claim."

"So when will you have it?" says Freda.

It was half time during a Maccabi youth team football match and Henry, the manager of one of the sides, calls over Lawrence, one of his 9year old players and says to him, "Do you understand what co-operation is, Lawrence? Do you know what a team is?"

"Yes," replies Lawrence.

"Do you therefore understand," continues Henry, "that it’s the team that counts and what matters most is whether we win or lose together as a team?"

Lawrence again replies, "yes."

"OK," Henry says, "so when the referee sees a foul and blows his whistle, one shouldn't swear, argue, attack him or call him a shmuck head and a putz. Nor is it good sportsmanship to call a manager 'a dumb ass hole.' Do you agree?

Again Lawrence says, "yes."

"Good," says Henry, "Now go over there and explain all that to your dad."

### #1561 Miracle petrol

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Renee is a very caring lady who spends a lot of her spare time visiting and helping sick members of her shul. Her car is also well known in the community because it’s decorated all over with lots of Hebrew decals and bumper stickers showing the Jewish charities she helps.

One day, as she is driving to one of the care homes she regularly visits, her car runs out of petrol and splutters to a stop. "Oy veh," she says to herself, "and just when I’m late."

Fortunately, she notices a petrol station only a few hundred yards away, so she walks to the station to get help. "Hi," Renee says to the man behind the till, "I’ve run out of petrol and I’m hoping you can lend me your petrol can. I’ll pay you for the petrol I use and I’ll return your can as quickly as possible."

The attendant replies, "I’m sorry, lady, but I’ve lent out my one and only can not more than 5 minutes ago. I’m expecting it back in about half an hour, so if you want, you can wait here for it."

But as she’s behind schedule, Renee goes back to her car to find something that she could use to fill with petrol. Then, what mazel, she notices the bedpan she always keeps handy in case of patient need. So she takes the bedpan to the petrol station, fills it and carries it back to her car.

Two men are passing by and watch her pour in the petrol. One turns to the other and says, "If the car starts, I'm turning Jewish."

### #1562 The mother of God

Sister Maria, a very devout nun, dies and goes to heaven. She’s greeted at the gates by St. Peter with a fanfare of trumpets. St. Peter then says to her, "Whilst we’re getting your place ready, are there any questions you want to ask me, or is there anything I can do for you?"

"If it’s possible," replies Sister Maria, "I would love to meet the Holy Mother Mary."

St. Peter immediately takes her to a little building nearby and knocks on the door. "Come in," says a gentle voice from inside.  Sister Maria enters and sees a middle-aged woman dressed in the clothes of biblical times sitting on a wooden chair knitting. So Sister Maria sits down at Mary’s feet and waits to be addressed.

Mary looks up from her knitting and says, "Yes, my child, you have a question for me?"

"Reverend Mother," says Sister Maria, "you were a simple woman, yet you were chosen from all the women on Earth to be the Mother of God. Could you give me just a brief idea of what you were thinking of when Jesus was born?"

With a glazed look in her eyes, Mary replies with a sigh, "Oy veh. Ich hob dafke gevolt a maydel."   (Well, I was really hoping for a girl)

"Why do you have to think of such a thing just before I go to sleep?"

"Because I'm hot, hot, hot, that’s why, Leah."

"You always get hot at the wrong times, Moshe."

"If you really loved me, you wouldn’t be making me beg you."

"Well, if you really loved me, you'd be more considerate."

"Don’t you love me anymore?"

"Of course I do, Moshe, but let's forget it for tonight."

"Oh please, Leah."

"OK, OK, I'll do it - anything for a quiet life!"

"What's keeping you?"

"I can't find it."

"Oh, for heaven's sake, Leah, feel for it."

"There! Now are you satisfied?"

"Oy veh, that's good."

"Is it up far enough?"

### #1565 Translation problems

Hyman and Isaac are discussing the problems in translating from one language to another. Hyman says, "Did you know, Isaac, that there are some English words and expressions that are very difficult to translate into Yiddish."

"You surprise me," says Isaac, "can you give me an example?"

"Well," replies Hyman, "I’ve always had difficulty in finding a Yiddish word that adequately covers the meaning of the English word ‘disappointed.’"

Isaac thinks for a while and says, "Mmm, I see what you mean, Hyman. Look, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. My mother speaks only Yiddish, so I'll ask her tonight how one says, ‘disappointed’ in Yiddish."

That night, Isaac says to his mother, "Mum, I always come here for dinner on Friday nights. So how would you feel if I were to tell you that I won’t be coming here next Friday?"

Isaac mother replies, "Oy! Ich'll zein zayer disappointed."

### #1566 Proof of age

David reaches 60 years of age and is now entitled to a Freedom Pass (for free travel on London buses and tubes). So he goes to the Post Office to pick up his pass. After queuing for nearly 20mins, he finally gets to the counter and says to the lady clerk, "Could I please have a Freedom Pass."

"OK," says the clerk, "but first I need to see either your passport or your driver's license so that I can verify your age."

After fumbling in his pockets for a while, David says to the clerk, "I’m very sorry, but I’ve left my documents at home. They’re still sitting on my sideboard."

But before David can leave, the clerk says to him, "Don’t go. Maybe I can check your age another way. Please open your shirt."

David does what he’s asked and opens his shirt, revealing a large mass of silver curly hair.

"That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me," says the clerk with a smile and promptly processes his application.

When David gets home, he can’t wait to tell his wife Andrea about his experience with the lady clerk at the Post Office. Andrea listens to his story then says, "You should also have pulled down your trousers and pants. She would then have given you a disability pension as well."

After a few minutes of this, Benjy asks, "Daddy, why is the man doing that?"

"Because," replies his father, "when you’re buying horses, you have to make sure that they’re healthy and in good condition before you buy."

Benjy looks a bit worried. "Daddy," he says, "I think Uncle Hymie wants to buy mummy."

[My thanks to Sydney for the following]

Boris, a kunyehlemel, is making his way to a shivah house by bus. But he gets confused, gets off at the wrong stop and ends up in a red light district. This doesn’t deter Boris, however. Thinking he’s in the right road, he finds the house number he’s looking for and rings the doorbell. The door opens and there stands a voluptuous woman.

She immediately grabs hold of his arm, schleps him in, takes him upstairs and gives him sex. When the deed is done, Boris leaves the room. He’s half way down the stairs when the woman shouts to him, "Excuse me, mister, haven’t you forgotten something?"

Boris thinks for a second, then replies, "Oh yes – I wish you long life."

"OK," says Issy, "how much is this going to cost me?"

"The 12 sessions plus drugs will cost you £1,000," replies doctor Myers.

"Oy," says Issy, "I’m not a wealthy man, doctor. Couldn’t you make it less?"

"Well … I could do it for £850," replies doctor Myers.

"It’s still more than I can afford, doctor," says Issy, "I’ve 3 children and a Jewish wife to support."

"OK," says doctor Myers, "how about £700?"

"It’s still too high, doctor," says Issy. "My business is doing terrible and my wife has told her mother that she can live with us."

"Alright already," says doctor Myers, "I’ll do it for £600 and not a penny less."

"Thanks doctor, I can accept that," says Issy.

"Good," says doctor Myers, "but tell me – why did you come to me to seek treatment when you know I’m the most expensive doctor in this area?"

"Well," replies Issy, "you’ve got a marvellous reputation and when it comes to my health, money is no object!"

### #1582 Jewish blood

Although Sean, a wealthy businessman, is only 40, he needs a heart transplant. But as he has a very rare blood group, he has to wait until his doctors can find a suitable blood donor. Fortunately, Sean doesn't have to wait too long - Benny has the same blood type and is willing to donate some of his blood to help out.  After the surgery, Sean shows his appreciation by sending Benny a thank you card and a cheque for £10,000.  Benny is very surprised to receive this – after all, he didn’t agree to donate his blood for any reward. Sean’s priest also writes to Benny saying that it’s so good to see such co-operation between the faiths.

Ten years later, Sean needs another operation and his doctors immediately contact Benny to see whether he's willing to donate his blood again. Once more, Benny agrees. After the surgery, Sean shows his appreciation by sending Benny a thank you card and £250 worth of Marks & Spencer gift tokens.  Benny is once again appreciative as he didn’t agree to donate his blood for any reward.

Sean's wife, however, is not at all happy that her husband hasn’t rewarded Benny in the same generous manner as before. So she asks him why.

"Bubbeleh," replies Sean, "don’t be such a shmo. My new blood has given me some saychel and it’s obvious to me why I can’t reward Benny as I did before. Our beautiful daughter Jane, kin-a-hora, is getting married next year to a wonderful mensh and because I don’t want to be seen as a shnorrer, I’ve got to find a lot of gelt to pay for the simcha."

After the funeral, the Union’s General Secretary phones Peter Smith for a report on how the funeral went.

"Well," says Peter, "sometimes I think Jews can be as crazy as the rest of us. When I got there, this little man with a beard came up to me and asked if I was a brother. When I said I was, he took out a penknife and started cutting up my suit."

### #1590 The jokers

[My thanks to Laurence F for this new version of an old joke]

Laurence the explorer hires the best jungle guide there is to take him into the middle of darkest Africa. After months of travel, they arrive at a jungle clearing and there, sitting in a circle, is Big Chief Levy and all his tribe.  As Laurence watches, one of the natives calls out, "44" and everyone in the circle, including Chief Levy, all laugh out loud. Then another native calls out, "63" and again they all laugh loudly.

Laurence is surprised by this behaviour and tells his guide to find out more about the ceremony. The guide speaks to the Chief, returns to Laurence and explains that the tribe always enjoys a good joke. Each joke has been given a number and to save time telling the jokes, they just call out its number.  Laurence immediately tells his guide to get him invited to join the circle. The guide speaks to the Chief, returns to Laurence and says, "Chief Levy say you can join the circle and tell one joke."

Laurence joins the circle and calls out, "27."  But no-one laughs. There isn't even a titter – just complete silence. Even the birds are quiet. So Laurence tells his guide, "Ask Chief Levy why no one laughed at my joke."  The guide does as he’s told and when he returns, he says, "They didn't like the way you told joke 27."

Laurence tells his guide to get him one more go. The guide comes back and says, "You lucky. Chief Levy say you can have just one more go."

Laurence calls out, "159"... and instantly, Chief Levy and his whole tribe fall about with raucous laughter for ten minutes.  When the laughter finally dies down, Laurence asks his guide to find out what happened this time.  The guide speaks to the Chief, returns to Laurence and says, "Chief Levy say, 'Great!  We hadn't heard that one before.'"

There are three brothers called David, Henry and Alan. One day, they meet Peter, who has just moved into the house next door to them. Unfortunately, Peter is cross-eyed.

"What’s your name?" Peter asks David.

"Henry," replies Henry.

"I wasn’t talking to you," Peter says to Henry.

"But I didn’t say anything," says Alan.

### #1592 The book competition

Rabbi Josephs has an appointment to see his old friend Rabbi Bloom and Lionel, the shammes, kindly agrees to drive him there. When they arrive, Rabbi Bloom is on the phone and asks them to wait in his study.

As soon as they enter the study, Rabbi Josephs walks over to the well stocked bookcase and begins to look carefully at the many books on display. Suddenly, Rabbi Josephs pulls a book from the shelf, opens it, scans the pages and goes very pale. Still holding the book, he has to sit down for a moment. When the colour comes back to his face, he gets up, kisses the book and puts it back on the shelf. Lionel doesn’t say anything because he doesn’t understand what’s going on.

But then it happens again. Rabbi Josephs takes hold of another book, opens the pages, stares at what he finds and as before, has to sit down in case he faints. A few moments later, he gets up, kisses the book and replaces it. This time, Lionel decides to ask Rabbi Joseph if everything is OK.

"Rabbi," Lionel asks, "what was wrong with that book you just put back?"

"Nothing Lionel, nothing at all," replies Rabbi Joseph, smiling. "Just for a moment there, I thought Rabbi Bloom had another book I didn't have."

### #1594 The fishing trip

Jonathan phones home and tells his wife Rachel, "Darling, my boss has just asked me to go fishing with him to the Lake District. We’re leaving this afternoon and several of our top clients are joining us there. This is a fantastic opportunity for me to get that promotion I've been waiting for, so could you please pack my small suitcase for me. Put in enough clothes for a week, including my new blue silk pyjamas and get out my rod and tackle box. We're leaving the office in about 30 minutes and we’ll stop by the house to pick up my things."

Rachel thinks this a bit odd, but nevertheless does what her husband asks. One week later, Jonathan returns home looking quite tired. Rachel welcomes him back and asks him if he caught many fish.

"Yes, darling," Jonathan replies, "lots of salmon and rainbow trout. We ate all we caught.  But why didn't you pack my blue silk pyjamas like I asked?"

"But I did," Rachel replies innocently, "they were in your tackle box."

MORAL: Men shouldn’t think they can outsmart women!

### #1596 The pair of trousers

Jeremy orders a pair of trousers from LEVINE BROS, TAILORS. Frank takes the order and tells Jeremy that they will be ready in a week’s time.

But when Jeremy returns a week later, he’s disappointed to learn that the trousers are not yet ready and that he has to come back in another week’s time.

But when Jeremy returns again the following week, he’s disappointed to learn that the trousers are still not ready and that he has to come back in another week’s time

This goes on for two months until finally, on Jeremy’s ninth visit, the trousers are ready for him. Frank proudly displays them not only to Jeremy but also to everyone in his shop.

"Thanks for the trousers, Mr Levine," says Jeremy, "but I need to ask you a question. How come God was able to create the world in only 6 days, yet it took you 60 days to make just one pair of trousers?"

"Ah, it’s simple," replies Frank. "Just look at the condition of the world and then take a look at this gorgeous pair of trousers I’ve made for you."

On the other hand, Freda doesn’t hate Abe enough to give him back his diamonds. She says, "I know money can't buy me happiness and I’m suffering, but at least I’m suffering in comfort."

So, it happened that a defence counsel, arguing in a recent summary judgment motion in federal court in Boston wrote, in a responsive pleading:

### #1602 The English lesson

Harry has reached 60 and for some reason seems to have lost the ability to make love to his wife Kitty. She is not amused and tells him, "So get it sorted out already, Harry."

Harry goes to see Doctor Myers. Two weeks later, after many tests and some lotions, potions and powders, nothing has improved for poor Harry, so Doctor Myers says, "May I suggest that you go see Vivian Agra, someone I met recently at a doctors’ convention. She’s very nice and specialises in erectile problems using ancient Indian treatments.

Harry goes to see Vivian and after a thorough examination, she says, "I can help you." She then takes some blue powder from a glass jar and throws it into a candle flame. There’s a bright flash and Harry is suddenly covered with billowing blue smoke. When the smoke clears, Harry says, "Is that it? I’m cured?"

Vivian replies, "Sort of. Even though it’s a powerful medicine, it’s only given you the chance to make love once a year.  To do that, all you have to do is say, '123,' and you’ll be able to ‘stay up’ for as long as you want."

"But," asks Harry, "what happens when it's over and I don't want to continue?" "All you or your wife has to do," replies Vivian, "is say ‘1234’ and it will ‘go down’.  But I must warn you - you won’t be able to enjoy another erection for 12 months."

When Harry gets home, he has a wide smile on his face as he tells Kitty, "It’s done. You just wait until tonight, my little sex kitten."

That night he gets ready for the main event. He showers, shaves and smears on his expensive aftershave.  As he gets into bed with Kitty, he says, "123."  Immediately, he becomes more aroused than ever before, exactly as Vivian predicted. But as he climbs on top of Kitty, she says to him, "What did you say 123 for?"

(And now you know why you shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition.)

### #1603 Solving mother’s problems

Miriam is a mother who’s having serious problems with her young son Nathan. She’s in such a state that her doctor recommends she see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. He then writes out a letter for her to give to the psychiatrist.

Later that week, Miriam has her first appointment with the psychiatrist. After he spends an hour talking to her, he says, "You seem to be far too upset and worried about Nathan than you ought to be. So, Miriam, I’m going to give you a prescription for some tranquillizers. These are the very latest on the market. Start taking them regularly from today and I’ll see you again in a month’s time."

On her next visit, the psychiatrist asks, "So, Miriam, you look much more relaxed than the last time I saw you. Have the tranquilizers I gave you calmed you down?"

"Yes, doctor, the pills have been marvellous. I feel so carefree," replies Miriam.

"And how is Nathan behaving?" he asks.

"Who cares?" replies Miriam with a ‘shrug’ of her arms.

### #1604 Familiar faces

Lionel and his wife Sharon have just done their weekly shopping at Marks & Spencer food hall and are now queuing to pay. Suddenly, remembering that she needs some money, Sharon leaves Lionel to pay while she goes outside to look for a cash dispenser.

Lionel pays for the food, but as he’s wheeling the trolley outside the store, he sees a gorgeous woman smiling at him. Then, to his surprise, she says to him, "Hello."

He starts to think, ‘She looks a bit familiar but I just can't place where I might know her from.’ So Lionel replies, "Hello. Do I know you?"

"I’m not sure," she replies, "I could be mistaken, but I think you might be the father of one of my children."

Lionel is shocked and immediately starts thinking back to the time of his one and only indiscretion. So, blushing heavily, he says to her, "Oy Veh, are you the lady I met some year’s back at my shul’s Chanukah party when my wife was at home in bed with the flu? When you and I had too much Palwin wine to drink? Where we found a nice quiet room in the secretary’s office and made great love, with you scratching my back with your nails in your excitement?"

There is a short pause...

"No, you’ve got the wrong woman," she replies with a smile, "I'm your son's Science teacher!"

### #1605 I love that bike

Renee and Lawrence take their 4 year old daughter Talia to the OY VEH TOY STORE in Golders Green. The toy that immediately catches Talia’s eye is a beautiful pink 3 wheeler Barbie bike. She gets on it and rides around the store. One hour later, she’s still on the bike and no matter how much Renee and Lawrence beg her to get off, Talia refuses. The shop floor staff try and even Sidney the store manager tries, but to no avail. Talia won’t get off the bike and begins throwing temper tantrums.

Sidney quickly decides that it can’t hurt to call in Benjy Levy, the famous child psychologist, whose office is only a few minutes walk away. He just might be able to help.

"Is that Benjy Levy?" asks Sidney.

"Yes it is," replies Benjy, "how can I help?"

"I’m from OY VEH TOYS and I was wondering whether you could spare a few minutes to help us with a difficult child," asks Sidney.

"Yes, of course," replies Benjy, "I’m leaving the office now."

Five minutes later, Benjy arrives and immediately goes over to Talia. He smiles, leans over and whispers something in Talia’s ear. Straight away, with no arguing at all, Talia gets off the pink bike and runs over to her parents and within minutes, they have left the store to go home. Sidney and his staff rush over to Benjy to ask what words of wisdom he used to get Talia off the bike.

"Oh, it was nothing special," said Benjy. "I used words than anyone could have used."

"So what were these words?" they all ask at once.

Benjy replies, "I said to her, ‘Now you listen here, tsatskelah, if you don't get off this bike right away, I'm going to give you such a potch on the toches that you won't be able to sit down for a week!’"

### #1606 There’s no need to worry

[My thanks to Diane M for the following joke]

As Freda, Hannah, Kitty and Naomi are playing Bridge one evening, Freda suddenly says, "I have a confession to make. We’ve known each other now for many years so I feel I can now tell you my secret. I’m a kleptomaniac."

"Oy!" moan the other three.

"But there’s no need to worry - I’ve never stolen from any of you and I never will. You’re my friends."

At that, Hannah says, "OK, since we’re having a confession session, I’d like to admit that I’m a nymphomaniac."

"Oy oy!" moan the other three.

"But there’s no need to worry - I’ve never tried to get ensnare any of your husbands and I never will. You’re my friends."

"Well then," says Kitty, "I’d like to admit that the reason I never married is that I’m a lesbian."

"Oy veh!" moan the other three.

"But there’s no need to worry - I will never make any overtures to any of you. You’re my friends."

Naomi then stands up and says, "I too have a confession to make. I’m a yenta. And now could you please excuse me - I have a lot of calls to make."

"Gevalt!" moan the other three.

### #1607 Too clever by half

Isaac arrives in London from Canada and takes a job working on the shop floor of HYMIE’S SUPERMARKET. One day, a customer asks him where he can find half a head of lettuce and Isaac tells him that they only sell whole heads of lettuce. But the customer is insistent and gets Isaac to consult with Hymie. So Isaac goes into the back room and says to Hymie, "Some idiot wants to buy a half a head of lettuce."

As he finishes his sentence, Isaac turns to find the customer standing right behind him, so he quickly adds, "And this gentleman offered to buy the other half."

Hymie approves the deal and the customer leaves satisfied. Later that day, Hymie says to Isaac, "I was very impressed with the way you got yourself out of that tricky situation earlier. We like people who can think on their feet here. Where are you from?"

"I’m from Canada, sir," Isaac replies.

"So why did you leave Canada?" Hymie asks.

"Because too many yentas and hockey players live there," replies Isaac, smiling.

"That’s quite surprising," says Hymie, looking angry. "My wife is from Canada."

Isaac replies, "You don’t say? Who did she play for?"

### #1609 For all you Moshes out there, an explanation to help you understand ‘woman-speak’

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

FINE: This is the word she uses to end an argument when she feels she is right and you need to shut up. Never use "Fine" to describe how she looks as this will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES: This is half an hour. It’s equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the rubbish, so it's an even trade.

NOTHING: This actually means something and you should be on your toes. It’s usually used to describe the feeling she has of wanting to turn you inside out and upside down. It usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with "Fine."

GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows): This is a dare, one that will result in her getting upset over "Nothing" and end with the word "Fine."

GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows): This means ‘I give up’ or ‘do what you want because I don't care.’ You’ll get a "Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead" in just a few minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she’ll talk to you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH: This is not actually a word, but is a nonverbal statement often misunderstood by men. It means that she thinks you’re an idiot at that moment and wonders why she’s wasting her time standing there and arguing with you over "Nothing."

SOFT SIGH: Again, this is a nonverbal statement, not a word and means that she’s content. Your best bet is not to move or breathe and she’ll stay content.

THAT'S OK: This is one of the most dangerous statements that she can make to you and means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you’ve done. It’s often used with the word "Fine" and in conjunction with a "Raised Eyebrow."

GO AHEAD: At some point in the near future, you’re going to be in some serious trouble.

PLEASE DO: This is not a statement, it’s an offer. She is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you’ve done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's OK."

THANKS: She is thanking you. Don’t faint. Just say ‘you're welcome.’

THANKS A LOT: This is very different to "Thanks." She will say, "Thanks A Lot" when she’s really ticked off at you. It signifies that you’ve offended her in some callous way and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."  Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh" as she will only tell you "Nothing."

### #1610 For all you Sadies out there, an explanation to help you understand ‘man-speak’

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

IT'S A GUY THING: There’s no rational thought pattern connected with this and you have no chance at all of making it logical.

CAN I HELP WITH DINNER?: What he really wanted to say was, "Why isn't dinner already on the table?"

UH HUH; SURE, HONEY; OR YES, DEAR: This is a conditioned response and means absolutely nothing.

IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO EXPLAIN: This is another way of saying, "I have no idea how it works."

I WAS LISTENING TO YOU. IT'S JUST THAT I’VE THINGS ON MY MIND: What this really means is, "I wasn’t listening to you because I was wondering if that blond over there was wearing a bra."

TAKE A BREAK DARLING, YOU’RE WORKING TOO HARD: What he really wanted to say was, "I can't hear the football match on the TV. Please turn off the vacuum cleaner."

THAT'S INTERESTING, DEAR: This is another way of saying, "Are you still talking?"

YOU KNOW HOW BAD MY MEMORY IS: This means, "I remember all the words to 'My Way'; the name of the first girl I kissed; and the registration numbers of every car I've owned - but I forgot your birthday."

I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU SO I GOT YOU THESE FLOWERS: This really means, "The girl selling flowers on the corner was a real beauty, so I bought some from her."

HEY, I'VE GOT MY REASONS FOR WHAT I'M DOING: But what he didn’t add was, "And I sure hope I think of some pretty good reasons soon.”

WHAT DID I DO THIS TIME?: What he really wanted to say was, "What did you catch me at this time?"

I HEARD YOU: What this means is, "I haven't the foggiest clue what you just said and I’m hoping desperately that I can fake it well enough so that you don't spend the next 3 days yelling at me.

YOU KNOW I COULD NEVER LOVE ANYONE ELSE: This really means, "I’m used to the way you shout at me, and I realise it could be worse."

YOU LOOK TERRIFIC: What he really wanted to say was, "Please don't try on one more outfit, I'm absolutely starving."

### #1611 The celebratory Chinese meal

Yitzhak and Hannah decide to eat out to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary and after some deliberation, they choose the KOSHER MOSHE Chinese restaurant. When they arrive, they discuss the menu with the waiter and agree to share the chef's special ‘Chicken Surprise.’  After a short wait, the waiter brings over their meal, which is served inside a lidded cast iron pot, and departs without removing the lid.

Hannah is ready to start eating but before she can reach over to the pot, the lid suddenly rises by 1cm all by itself. Hannah looks closely at the pot and briefly sees two beady little eyes looking at her. Then the lid slams back down again.

Hannah is worried. "Did you see that?" she asks Yitzhak.

"No, darling, I didn’t," replies Yitzhak.

"So look in the pot already," she tells Yitzhak.

As he reaches for the lid, it again rises up by 1cm all by itself. Yitzhak looks closely and sees two beady little eyes looking at him. Then the lid firmly slams back down again.

Hannah starts to panic and shouts at Yitzhak, "Call the manager over, CALL THE MANAGER OVER."

So Yitzhak gets the manager and they tell him what they saw and demand an explanation.

"Well sir, I think I can explain," says the manager. "What did you order?"

"We both chose the same," Yitzhak replies, "the Chicken Surprise."

"Oh I do apologize," says the manager, "the waiter brought you the ‘Peking Duck' by mistake."

### #1612 The lost girl

One Sunday, little Rachel and her bubbeh go to Brent Cross Shopping Centre to buy a present for Rachel. Unfortunately, while shopping, Rachel gets separated from her bubbeh and immediately starts to cry. A security guard sees the sobbing little girl and takes her to the lost-and-found office. When they ask Rachel for her name, she replies, "Shana Punam Kenahorah Poo Poo Poo."

So they again ask her for her name and she replies, "My name is Shana Punam Kenahorah Poo Poo Poo."

So the office puts out the following message over the Tannoy,

"We have in our lost-and-found office a cute brown eyed, blond haired little girl who has lost her grandmother. If you are that grandmother, please come and claim your granddaughter, "Shana Punam Kenahorah Poo Poo Poo."

Five bubbehs immediately come running to claim her.

### #1613 PC trouble

Sarah is having trouble on her PC with her Outlook emails, so she telephones Joshua the computer expert and asks him to come over and sort it out for her. As soon as he arrives, it takes Joshua only a few minutes to solve the problem. He then gives Sarah an invoice for £25, his minimum service charge, and turns to leave. As he’s walking away, she shouts after him, "So nu? What was wrong with it, Joshua?"

"It was an ‘ID ten T’ error," he replies.

Sarah doesn’t want to appear stupid, but nonetheless asks him, "An ‘ID ten T’ error? What's that...in case I need to fix it again?"

Joshua grins and replies, "Haven't you heard of an ‘ID ten T’ error before?"

"No," she replies.

"So write it down," he says, "and then I think you'll figure it out."

So Sarah writes out ..... I D 1 0 T

PS She used to like Joshua, but doesn’t anymore.

[My thanks to Cliff L for the following]

Ruth is visiting Brent Cross shopping centre when she meets Esther. It’s the first time they’ve met since leaving school and they quickly get talking. Ruth says, "You were always so well organized in school, Esther, so I’m wondering, are you now living the well planned life you always said you would?"

"Oh yes Ruth, I certainly am," replies Esther. "My first marriage was to a multi-millionaire property developer; my second marriage was to a West End musical star; my third marriage was to Rabbi Levy, and at present I'm married to the chairman of The United Synagogue Burial Society."

"But I don’t understand, Esther," says Ruth. "What on earth do your marriages have to do with a well planned life?"

"Well it’s easy really," replies Esther. "It’s ….  One for the Money, Two for the Show, Three to get Ready, and Four to Go."

[My thanks to Hilary for the following joke]

Einstein the scientist starts getting home later and later in the evenings. Then one day, he comes home at 2.30am. His shirt is torn, there are lipstick stains on his neck, and his wiry hair is even more dishevelled than it usually is. As soon as he steps foot inside his house, his wife jumps out from behind the front door, grabs hold of him, shakes him and shouts, "So why have you once again come home so late?"

"Well," he replies, "as I was leaving work at 5.30pm today, I met some friends and they persuaded me to go with them and have a few quick drinks. We then met some good looking young ladies inside the bar and …. well, to be honest, we all started to drink more than we could handle, as you can probably see. But I managed to sober up just enough to see how late it was. So I called a taxi and …. here I am."

"You’re a liar," she screams at him, "you were in the lab again working on your stupid relativity theory, weren't you?"

"To tell the truth, it makes me so farklempt, I'm fit to plutz. This whole schmeer gets me broyges when I hear these mavens and luftmenschen kvetching about our national language. What chutzpah!"

"These shmegeges can tout their shlock about the cultural and linguistic diversity of our country and of English itself, but I, for one, am not buying their shtick.

It wouldn't be shayich to do anything else."

### #1617 Sarah’s cruise diary

DEAR DIARY - DAY 1

The taxi has arrived to take me to the Port for the start of my Mediterranean cruise. I'm really excited, even though my Moshe is not able to join me on this trip.  I've packed all my Gucci outfits, my breakfast wear, my sports wear, my lounge wear, my evening wear and my seductive negligees. And I only needed 7 suitcases.

DEAR DIARY - DAY 2

We spent the entire day at sea. It was beautiful and I saw some whales and dolphins. What a wonderful holiday this has started to be. I met the Captain today - he seems like a very nice man.

DEAR DIARY - DAY 3

Today I spent some time in the ship’s swimming pool. I also played bridge with some ladies in the piano bar and did some aerobics. The Captain invited me to join him at his table for dinner. I felt honoured and had a wonderful time. He’s a very attractive and attentive gentleman.

DEAR DIARY - DAY 4

I spent the morning in the ship's casino and won £95. The Captain invited me to have dinner with him, this time in his state room. He somehow knew I was Jewish and so our menu was knaidelach soup followed by hot salt beef, roast potatoes and latkes, plus some new green cucumbers and hot peppers, followed by a lockshen pudding. The champagne he chose was very nice. Afterwards, he asked me to stay the night with him but I declined - I told him there was no way I could be unfaithful to my Moshe. The Captain seemed upset after all the thought he had put into the meal.

DEAR DIARY - DAY 5

I went back to the top-side swimming pool today and got a little sunburned so decided to spend the rest of the day in the piano bar. The Captain saw me there and bought me a couple of drinks. He really is a charming man. He again asked me to spend the night with him. But when I again declined, he got angry and told me that if I didn't stay the night with him tomorrow, he would sink the ship. I was obviously horrified and very worried.

DEAR DIARY - DAY 6

I saved 1,600 lives today – twice!

### #1618 Seven reasons why God Created Eve

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

1. God was worried that Adam, being alone, would regularly get lost in the garden of Eden because he refused to ask for directions

2. God knew right from the start that Adam would eventually need someone to find the remote and then hand it to him

3. God knew that Adam didn’t have any idea how to choose the latest style of fig leaf when his old one wore out. He would therefore need someone to choose one for him

4. God knew that Adam would never be able to make an appointment with a doctor, dentist or hairdresser all by himself

5. God knew that Adam was having difficulty in remembering which days he needed to put the recyclable rubbish in the ‘green’ bin

6. God knew that if the world was to be populated, Adam would never be able to handle the pain and discomfort of childbearing

7. When God finished creating Adam, he stepped back, scratched his head, and said, "I can do better than that."

### #1620 Nothing ever changes

[My thanks to Hillary A for the following]

Daniel arrives home from work at 5pm and as soon as he steps through his front door, his wife Judith starts having a go at him. “Why don’t you ever wipe your feet before walking into the house? ….. I thought you said you were coming home at lunch time today …… Where’s the shopping I asked you to get on the way home? ….. You left the toilet seat up again this morning. ….  Don’t you ever think of buying me shabbes flowers, like you used to do? …."

This incessant criticism, nagging and complaining goes on for nearly 2 hours - nothing Daniel says or does seems to be right by her. By 7pm, Daniel has had enough. But he knows better than to have a go at Judith so he tries a more tactical approach.

"Darling," he says, "Please - let’s start again. I’ll go back outside and shut the door. Then I’ll open the door and come in. We can then pretend I’ve just come home. What do you think?"

"OK," she replies.

So Daniel puts on his coat, goes outside, shuts the door, waits a minute, opens the door, and steps in with a smile on his face. He immediately announces, in a musical tone, "Oh darling, I’m home.”

"And just where have you been?" says Judith, "It's past seven o'clock!"

Lawrence and Monty are in the jewellery business but they are not doing at all well. So much so that one day, Lawrence says, "we’re going into a new gesheft and we’re going to make a fortune."

"What new gesheft?" asks Monty.

"We’re going into washing powders," replies Lawrence.

"Washing powders?" says Monty, looking very puzzled, "what do we know from washing powders?"

"Listen, you shmuck," says Lawrence, "it’s easy. We buy crates and crates of the powder from a wholesaler for next to gornisht and put it into little cardboard boxes. Then we sell the boxes for £1.99 each and soon we’ll be rich."

"No, you listen to me, potts," says Monty. "We’ll need to advertise the boxes and that will cost us a fortune."

"OK, so let’s advertise. What’s the problem? I’ve already though of it. We can even advertise on TV," says Lawrence.

"Meshuggeneh," says Monty, "We’ll also need to hire a well known publicity agent and he’ll cost us a lot of gelt to come up with a suitable product name."

"But I’ve already thought of a good name," says Lawrence.

"OK clever clogs," says Monty, "what name do you have?"

"We’ll call it FEKS WASHING POWDER," replies Lawrence.

"What rubbish," says Monty, "how can anyone come up with a slogan for a product with the name of FEKS WASHING POWDER?"

"But I’ve already thought of a slogan," says Lawrence.

"OK wise guy," says Monty, "let’s hear your slogan."

"Right," says Lawrence. "IF OMO DOESN’T WASH YOUR WHITES WHITER, AND PERSIL DOESN’T MAKE YOUR COLOURS BRIGHTER, THEN FEK IT."

### #1622 A cry for help

Abe is travelling on a bus to Golders Green. It’s a hot day and everyone on board is quiet and subdued. Suddenly, Abe hears what seems to him to be a cry for help from the back of the bus. He looks to find out who is making the noise and sees that it’s an elderly bubbeh.

"Oy, am I thirsty," she cries out, "Oy, am I thirsty."

This is repeated over and over again every few minutes. "Oy, am I thirsty. Oy, am I thirsty," and each time, there is more and more pain to the bubbeh’s voice.

This quickly begins to get on Abe’s nerves, so he gets the bus driver to stop at the next corner and he goes to get the kvetcher a drink already. When he returns, he goes straight to the bubbeh with a bottle of mineral water and says, "Here grandma, drink up. And then be quiet, will you?"

The bubbeh drinks the water, Abe goes back to his seat and the bus continues on its journey. Some passengers begin to nod off again, others start reading their newspapers and the rest are just relieved that the old bubbeh is quiet.

All of a sudden they hear from the back of the bus, "Oy, vas I thirsty… Oy, vas I thirsty."

### #1624 Sheer love

[My thanks to Allan D for the following]

Monty is in John Lewis department store to buy his wife Leah a 70th birthday present. He looks around the Lingerie department and decides to buy some sheer lingerie for her. So he goes over to a salesgirl to explain what he wants. She shows him many different types ranging in price from £35 to £280. The most sheer item is, of course, the most expensive, but as nothing is too good for his Leah, he chooses the £280 item. He pays for it and the salesgirl gift wraps it nicely for him.

When he gets home, Monty kisses Leah and says, "Happy birthday, darling, this is for you."

Leah opens the package, smiles and says, "Thanks for such a nice surprise."

"I’m glad you like it," says Monty, "why don’t you put it on now and model it for me?"

"OK," she says and goes upstairs with her present. But as soon as she sees the receipt, which Monty had forgotten to remove from the bag, she says to herself, "It’s really such a waste of money. It's so sheer that it might as well be nothing. I won't need to put it on - Monty won’t notice if I do the modelling naked. Then I can return it tomorrow and keep the £280 refund for better things."

Soon, Leah comes downstairs, naked, and starts to do some poses for Monty. Monty looks carefully at Leah and says, "Oy vay! For £280, you’d have thought they would have ironed it for me."

PS   Monty never saw the frying pan as it hit him behind his head. The levoyah is on Thursday.

### #1625 I might be six minutes late

Cyril gets a new job at Rothschilds Bank and immediately gets on well with his fellow investment bankers. So much so that a group of them who meet for a round of golf every Sunday ask Cyril whether he’d like to join them this Sunday at 10am.

"I’d love to," replies Cyril, "thanks for asking. But I might be 6 minutes late."

"No problem," they reply.

Cyril turns up on Sunday exactly at 10am, golfs right-handed and posts the lowest score. They congratulate him and invite him to join them again next Sunday.

"I’ll be there," Cyril says, "but I might be 6 minutes late."

The following Sunday, Cyril turns up exactly at 10am, golfs left-handed and posts the lowest score. They again congratulate him.

This continues for a number of Sundays, with Cyril always saying that he might be 6 minutes late, and always posting the lowest score, whether he golfs left or right handed.

One Sunday, in the bar after their round of golf, his colleagues ask, "Cyril, we hope you don’t mind us asking, but every Sunday you tell us that you might be 6 minutes late, but you never are. And then, whether you play left or right-handed, you still post the lowest score. What’s it all about?"

"It’s no great deal," replies Cyril, "I’m very superstitious. Every Sunday, when I awake, I look over at my beautiful wife Freda. If she’s sleeping on her left side, I golf left handed and if she’s sleeping on her right side, I golf right handed."

"But what if your Freda is sleeping on her back?" they ask.

Cyril replies, "Then I’m going to be 6 minutes late."

Dr. Minky, a psychiatrist and Dr. Lau, a proctologist, open a medical practice in Hendon. But they have great difficulty in getting the local council to agree to the wording on the sign they want to put up outside their office. These are the signs they try, but which are not accepted by the council.

"Hysterias and Posteriors"

"Schizoids and Haemorrhoids"

"Catatonics and High Colonics"

"Manic Depressives and Anal Retentives"

"Minds and Behinds"

"Lost Souls and Butt Holes"

"Analysis and Anal Cysts"

"Nuts and Butts"

"Freaks and Cheeks"

"Loons and Moons"

Almost at their wit's end, the doctors finally come up with a sign which the council approves. It reads, "Dr. Minky and Dr. Lau, Odds and Ends."

### #1631 Dead or alive

Ever since the Jewish Chronicle printed his obituary in error, Hymie just can’t get it out of his mind that he really is dead. His delusion becomes such a problem that his sons finally pay for a psychiatrist to visit him to sort him out.

The psychiatrist spends many laborious sessions trying to convince Hymie that he is, indeed, still alive, but nothing seems to work.

Finally the psychiatrist tries one last time. He takes some medical books with him to help him prove to Hymie that dead men can’t bleed. After an hour of argument and book reading, it seems that he has finally succeeded.

"So, Hymie," says the psychiatrist, "do you now agree with the medical establishment that dead men don't bleed?"

"Yes," replies Hymie.

"Very well then," says the psychiatrist as he pricks Hymie's finger with a pin causing it to bleed a little, "look at this. What does that blood tell you, Hymie?"

"Oy vay," says Hymie, as he stares incredulously at his finger, "it means that dead men really do bleed."

### #1633  What a lovely sunny day

[My thanks to Shlomo for the following]

One morning, as soon as Isaac and Fay wake up, Isaac opens the curtains and says, “Oh my, what a lovely sunny day it is today.”

The following day, as they are sitting on their terrace having tea and biscuits, Isaac looks up at the sky and says, “What a beautiful sunny day it is today, dear.”

The next day, as they’re driving to Brent Cross shopping centre, Isaac looks out the window and remarks, "Isn’t it a lovely sunny day today?"

By now, Fay is getting a bit farmisht by Isaac’s regular rantings about the weather. So she says to him, "What’s with you? Are you going meshugga? What’s with all the talk about sunny days?”

“It’s because," replies Isaac, "you told me once that one sunny day you’re going to leave me and you’re never coming back.”

### #1635 The insurance policies

Old Emanuel dies. All of his life he’d been dealing in second-hand cuff links and never got rich as a result. But one month after Emanuel’s death, his widow Leah gets a shock, and surprise, when 3 cheques arrive in the morning’s post - one cheque for each of the 3 life assurance policies Emanuel had taken out without her knowing. She adds up the 3 cheques and, Oy Veh, she’s rich – they total more than £175,000.  She immediately phones her daughter.

"Suzy," she says, "your dear father, God bless his soul, worked long and hard all his life to provide for us. We lived poor but contented. But now, just when we get some real money, Emanuel is not around to enjoy any of it."

### #1639 The watch

[My thanks to Robert R for the following]

Hymie is in Brent Cross shopping centre when he sees someone he knows. It’s Estelle, a rather attractive widow, and she’s sitting all alone on a bench. So, being both a widower and a bit of a playboy, he walks over to the bench and quietly sits down next to her. He gives her a quick glance then casually looks at his watch for a moment. Then he looks up at her again and then glances down at his watch.

Estelle turns round and sees it’s Hymie. "Oh hello Hymie," she says, "is anything the matter? Are you waiting for someone, because you keep on looking at your watch, then at me?"

"Oh no," replies Hymie, "I’ve just bought one of the world’s most advanced watches and I’m testing it out."

Estelle is intrigued. "An advanced watch?" she says. "So what's so special about it, Hymie? Why is it any different to mine?"

"OK, I’ll tell you why," replies Hymie. "It’s special because it uses Bluetooth waves to talk to me telepathically."

"OK then," says Estelle, "so what's it telling you right now?"

"It’s telling me loud and clear," replies Hymie, looking very serious, "that you're not wearing any panties."

"Well it must be broken then," Estelle says, giggling, "because I’m definitely wearing panties!"

At that, Hymie starts to tap on the face of his watch and says, "Oy veh, the watch must be an hour fast."

### #1640 Miriam’s shoes

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

It’s late December and little Miriam is getting ready to leave school. But she needs help in putting on her winter boots. So Sharon, her teacher, comes over to help.  The boots prove to be quite a challenge and even with Miriam pulling and Sharon pushing, the little boots didn't want to go on easily. It took Sharon some time to get both the boots on Miriam’s feet.

But then Miriam shouts out, "Teacher, they're on the wrong feet."

Sharon looks down and sure enough, they were. It wasn't any easier pulling the boots off than it was putting them on, but Sharon manages to keep her cool as, together, they work to get the boots back on, this time on the right feet.

But then Miriam shouts out, "These aren't my boots, teacher."

Sharon bites her tongue rather than shout at Miriam. "Why didn't you say so?"  Once again Sharon struggles to help Miriam pull the ill-fitting boots off her little feet. No sooner had they got the boots off when Miriam says, "They're my brother's boots, teacher. My mum made me wear them."

Now Sharon doesn’t know if she should laugh or cry. But she musters up what patience she has left to wrestle the boots on Miriam’s feet again. Then, helping Miriam into her coat, Sharon asks, "Now Miriam, where are your gloves?"

Miriam replies, "I stuffed them in the toes of my boots, teacher."

PS   Sharon will soon be coming out of psychiatric care.

### #1641 Captain Judith

Moshe is on a trip to London. As the El Al Jumbo airliner pushes back from the gate, the flight attendant gives the passengers the usual information regarding seat belts, etc. Finally, she announces, "Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Levy, and her crew take you safely to your destination."

When the flight attendant arrives with the drinks trolley, Moshe asks her, "Did I understand you correctly? Is this big plane really being flown by a woman?"

"Yes sir" replies the attendant, "in fact the plane’s entire crew is female."

"Oy veh," says Moshe, "I'd better have two gin and tonics. I don't know what to think of being on a plane with only women controlling it. Do you think you can arrange for me to go up to the cockpit to see for myself?"

"Yes of course sir," says the attendant, "but that's another thing you might like to know - we no longer call it the cockpit."

### #1643 The false teeth

[My thanks to Richard K for the following]

Moshe has been living in Poland all his life, but just before the 2nd World War, he sees big trouble coming. So he sells all his assets, converts them into gold and then melts down the gold to have five sets of false teeth made for him. He flees Poland and after much travelling, arrives at Ellis Island, New York, where he is interrogated by an immigration official who also goes through the contents of his battered suitcase.

When the official sees the 5 sets of false teeth, he asks Moshe why he has so many. Moshe replies, "As you might know, we orthodox Jews have two separate sets of dishes, one for meat and one for dairy products. However, I’m so kosher and religious that I also need to have separate sets of teeth."

The official is confused. "Well that accounts for two sets of teeth. What are the other three for?"

"Well," Moshe replies, "we ultra-Orthodox Jews also use separate dishes for Passover and I’m so observant that I need two sets of Passover teeth to go with the dishes, one for meat and one for dairy food."

The official is still confused. "You've convinced me that you're a highly religious man and I accept that you therefore need four sets of teeth. But what about the fifth set?"

"Well, to tell you the truth, mister official," replies Moshe, "every once in a while I like to eat a ham and cheese sandwich."

Dr. Minkofsky takes the phone and says, "Hi, what’s up?"

"Don’t worry, everything’s OK," replies Dr. Gold. "It’s just that I’m at home with Dr. Lewis and Dr. Kosiner. We’re having a little game of poker and we’re short of one hand so we thought you might like to come over and join us?"

"Sure .... yes, of course," replies Dr. Minkofsky, putting on a serious voice, "I’m leaving right now." And he puts down the phone.

"What’s happened?" his wife asks, with a worried look.

"It’s very serious," Dr. Minkofsky replies. "They’ve already called three doctors."

Rachel and Lionel are in the final phase of getting divorced, but, like many other divorces, it’s not plain sailing. They are now in court one last time - the issue being, who is going to keep their one and only child?

Rachel tells the judge, ”Your Honour, As I’m the one who carried my daughter, and as I’m the one who painfully gave birth to my daughter, it’s therefore only logical that I should be the one to keep her.”

The judge then asks Lionel, “Have you anything to say about your wife’s logic?”

Lionel thinks for a moment, then rises slowly to his feet and replies, “Yes your Honour, I do. If we’re into logic, then my question is this - if I insert a coin in a Pepsi vending machine and I get my can, whose can is it - the machines or mine?”

[My thanks to BMS and Allan D for the following]

Bill Gates decides to organize an enormous session of recruitment for a chairman for Microsoft Europe. The 5,000 candidates are all assembled in a large room. One of the candidates is Maurice Cohen, a little Parisian Jewish Tunisian. Bill Gates thanks all the candidates for coming and asks that all those who do not know the programming language JAVA PLUS to rise and leave. 2,000 people rise and leave the room.

But Maurice Cohen says to himself, "I don’t know this language, but vat haff I got to lose if I stay? I'll give it a try."

Bill Gates then asks all remaining candidates who have never had experience of team management of more than 100 people to rise and leave. 2,000 people rise and leave the room.

But Maurice Cohen says to himself, "Oy, I never managed anyvun but myself, but vat haff I got to lose if I stay? What can happen to me?" So he stays.

Bill Gates then asks all remaining candidates who don’t have degrees in People Management to rise and leave. 500 people rise and leave the room.

But Maurice Cohen says to himself, "Oy Vay, I left school at 15 so I never vent to university, but vat haff I got to lose if I stay?" So he stays in the room.

Bill Gates finally asks all the remaining candidates who don’t speak Serbo-Croat to rise and leave. 498 people rise and leave the room.

But Maurice Cohen says to himself, "Oy Vay Zmir, I don’t speak Serbo-Croat, but vat the hell! Haff I got anything to lose?" So he stays in the room and finds himself alone with one other candidate - everyone else has gone.

Bill Gates joins them and says, "Apparently you are the only two candidates who speak Serbo-Croat, so I'd now like to hear you both have a little conversation in that language." Calmly, Maurice Cohen turns to the other candidate and says to him, "Ma nishtana halaila hazeh mikol halelot."

The other candidate answers, "Shebechol halelot anu ochlin hamatz umatza."

### #1651 The barmitzvah invitation

[My thanks to Allan D for the following]

Dear ……..

It is with great stress (emotional and physical) and unbelievable financial hardship beyond your comprehension, that Rebecca and I cordially invite you to join us in kvelling over our wonderful son, Jonathan Sam, as he is called up to read the maftir and haftorah on his barmitzvah day.

Jonathan Sam’s special service takes place on Shabbes, May 19 at the Hendon United Synagogue. We realize this service might take place on FA Cup final day, but you can always tape it – the match that is, not the service.

The service commences at the ungodly (please excuse the language) hour of 9 o’clock in the morning and we would like you to be there at this time, even though you don't really need to be there until 10.30am, when the real action starts.

The service lasts for three hours and we hope you will be able to survive our rabbi’s speech and our chazan’s voice. If you do, you can skip the kiddush (which is usually only biscuits and grape juice) which will take place in the Ladies Guild room. This is just for those not invited to our main affair which takes place later on that evening.

So please join us at 7pm for an over-the-top, shmaltzy, ostentatious semi-kosher evening meal at the MCC (Mishegass Country Club). Rebecca wants me to mention that we had to join the MCC just to book their hall and, oy vay, you wouldn’t believe how much they charged us.

We’ve booked lots of expensive and noisy entertainment, including Minky’s Kosher Jammers Orchestra (with 6 singers) and Moshe the Jester.

Apart from Jonathan Sam’s friends, the guests will include 50 unruly teenagers, no doubt wearing expensive outfits and fake bling, and 70 middle-aged adults with lots of botox and real bling. At least a quarter of the guests will be hormonally and/or chronologically challenged, while others will act stupid while under the influence of the Palwin table wine we’ve ordered. And no doubt many will complain about the food (we would hope that you won’t be one of them.)

Please have the courtesy to complete the enclosed RSVP card in the next few days. I don’t want to receive it at the last minute - I just can't take any more stress. Also note that if you indicate on the card that you will be attending, I will have no choice but to invoice you £100 per person if you subsequently don’t show up for any reason.

In terms of what present to give Jonathan Sam, may we suggest it should be: flat; made of paper; with a signature and account number on it; and presented inside a small white envelope.   Any other types of gift are a waste of your time and ours.

We hope you can make it.

PS   Please bring your own kippot as I don't have any money left to buy these.

### #1652 A mourner’s lament

As Leah is visiting her late father’s grave in Bushey Cemetery, she passes close by a woman who is sobbing and wailing at another grave. Leah can easily hear that the woman is saying, "Oh why, oh why did you die? Why did you have to die?" This question is repeated many times.

After paying her respects to her father, Leah is leaving the cemetery when she again passes the sobbing woman. She is still wailing, "Why, oh why did you have to die?"

Leah feels pity for this woman and walks over to try to comfort her. "Pardon me, I hope you don’t mind me coming over, but I heard your cries of pain and anguish. I assume the deceased was a relative of yours?"

"No she’s not," says the other woman, "in fact I never met her before."

"Then why are you so sad?" asks Leah. "Who was she? Who is buried at this grave?"

"My husband’s first wife," replies the woman.

### #1653 The trouble with phobias

Simon has a problem. In fact he’s had a problem for so long that it’s beginning to worry him to death. Finally, he decides he has to do something about it and goes to see Dr Bloom, his local psychiatrist.

"Oy, doctor, have I got a problem," says Simon. "Every night, when I get into my bed, I think there's a crazy person under it ready to do me some serious harm. I'm going meshugga with fear. Please help me."

"Don’t worry, Simon," says Dr Bloom, "I can cure you of your fears, but it will not happen overnight."

"So how long will it take, doctor?" asks Simon.

"Well," replies Dr Bloom, thinking, "come to me twice a week for 3 months and I’ll rid you of your phobia."

"And how much do you charge a session, doctor?" asks Simon.

“My charges are £100 per session," replies Dr Bloom.

"But that will cost me £2,600 in total," says Simon. "I’m going to have to think about it and let you know. I can’t easily afford that kind of money."

Many months later, Simon meets Dr Bloom in Waitrose supermarket. "So why didn't you decide to let me cure you of your fears?" asks Dr Bloom.

"Well," replies Simon, "As I told you then, your fees were really too high for me. And then my rabbi gave me the cure for nothing. I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went on a week’s holiday to Tel Aviv."

"So how, may I ask, did your rabbi cure you?" asks Dr Bloom.

"Easy," replies Simon, "he told me to cut the legs off my bed. It’s now so low that nobody can possible get under it."

The lifeguard tells her to calm down. "Lady," he says, "please don't get too hysterical - I’m looking after your husband. I'm now going to give him some artificial respiration and I’m sure he'll then be fine."

"Vat do you mean artificial respiration?" Judith says to the lifeguard, "Mine Jacob gets either real respiration or he gets notting at all."

"But Morris," says the defence lawyer, "this burglary took place at night. Are you really sure you saw my client commit this crime?"

"Yes," says Morris, "I definitely saw him do it."

"Listen Morris," continues the defence lawyer, "you’re 80 years old and your eyes are probably not as good as they once were. Just how far can you see at night?"

### #1661 A Shtuken Nisht in Harts

[Excerpt from Jackie Mason's How To Talk Jewish]

Pronounced, ah SHTU-ken nisht in HEARTS.

It means "a stab in the heart" and it hurts like hell. It is anything that is a painful experience, a shocking, miserable memory. It happens every time a Jew passes a building that he could have bought twelve years ago for $1 million and learns that it's now worth $60 million. He just took a $59 million loss. That's a shtuken nisht in harts.

Other examples:

A guy just got a divorce, and goes to the bank to take out some money and finds his wife has been there first.

Or you took a girl to Atlantic City and when you open the door of your hotel room you find somebody else in bed with her.

Or you send your son to college to become a doctor and he comes home and tells you he wants to be a hairdresser.

"Yes, I agree," says Hyman. "By the way, Max, what’s the name of this world’s biggest diamond?"

"Koh-i-noor." replies Max.

"I might have guessed it would be a Jewish diamond," says Hyman.

### #1664 First day of school

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

A new year is starting at the Jewish Grammar School and on the first day of the new term, many of the children bring presents for their teachers.

Morris, whose mother owns the local Florist, brings in a lovely bouquet of flowers for Miss Shapiro his teacher. When Miss Shapiro receives them, she says to Morris, "Oh these flowers are lovely, Morris. I’m going to put them in my lounge as soon as I get home and I’m going to look at them and smell them all night."

Emma, whose father owns the local Newsagent, brings in a giant box of Belgium chocolates for Miss Gold her teacher. When Miss Gold receives it, she says to Emma, "Oh Emma, that’s so nice of you. I’m going to open the box as soon as I get home and make a pig of myself – I just love chocolates."

Bernie, whose father owns the local Kosher Wine shop, brings in a big, heavy box for Mr Levy his teacher. When Mr Levy receives it, he says to Bernie, "Thank you Bernie for my present. I’ve no idea what’s inside it and I can’t wait to get home to find out."

But then Mr Levy notices that the box is leaking a bit. So he touches a drop of the leaking liquid with his index finger, tastes it, then says, "I bet you’ve bought me some bottles of wine Bernie?"

"No, it’s not wine," says Bernie.

So Mr Levy tastes another drop and says, "Is it champagne then, Bernie?"

"No, it’s not champagne either," says Bernie. "It's a puppy."

### #1665 You have my blessing

Renee has been going out with Lionel, the latest of her many boyfriends, for three weeks and this time she really believes something will come of it - especially as he has just asked to meet with her parents. So that afternoon, Renee goes to her father and says, "Daddy, when Lionel arrives, there’s a very good chance that he’s going to come to you to ask for my hand in marriage."

Her father jumps up from his chair and shouts out ‘mazeltov,’ but before he can get too excited, Renee says, "But daddy, you must promise me something. All you need to say to him is a simple, 'yes, you have my blessing.' I beg you daddy, please don't do what you did last time with my previous boyfriend."

"So just what did I do last time?" asks her father, innocently.

"Well," replies Renee, "you fell on your knees, grabbed his hand and shouted out, ‘Oh, thank you my lovely boychick. Thank you, thank you. You’re my salvation.’"

### #1666 The Rabbi sends an email

[My thanks to Anna Read for her very own and very funny version of this joke which is given in full in her own words]

Rabbi Brewster was delighted to be asked to an international conference of religious leaders, especially when he heard it was to be held in Rotorua, New Zealand, an area famous for its volcanic and thermal features like boiling mud pools and natural hot springs. As he and his wife had not had a holiday for some time, they decided that she would join him after the conference.

The morning after he arrived, the Rabbi decided to send his wife an email, but unfortunately sent it to the wrong email address, that of the recent widow of a colleague....

"So how did it go mum?" asks Shoula.

"Well Shoula, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things are not so good. Unfortunately, in this case, things aren't so good. I’ve cancer. Let's go to my golf club and have a drink."

Later, after several martinis, the two are feeling a little less sombre. They have some laughs and then some more martinis. But after a while they’re approached by two of Sadie’s club mates who are curious as to what they are celebrating. Sadie tells them that they’re drinking to her impending death. "I’ve been diagnosed with AIDS," she tells them.

"Oy Veh," they say, and give Sadie their condolences. Then they all have a couple of martinis.

After Sadie’s friends leave, Shoula leans over and whispers, "Mum, I thought you said you were dying of cancer? You’ve just told your friends that you’re dying of AIDS. I’m confused mum."

Sadie replies, "I told them that because I don't want any of those kurveh sleeping with your father after I'm gone."

### #1672 Living in the past

[My thanks to Malcolm C for the following]

Morris and Ruth have just celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. That night, as they are getting ready for bed, Morris looks carefully at Ruth.

"What are you staring at?" Ruth asks.

"Darling," he replies, "I’ve been thinking. When we got married 25 years ago, we lived in a small apartment, we drove a cheap Ford car, we watched TV on a small 15inch black and white television and we couldn’t afford a proper bed so we had to make do with a sofa bed. However, despite all of that, I was proud to be sleeping with a sizzling 25 year old blonde.   Now, however, we have a large house in Hampstead, we drive a Lexus, we have a 42 inch Sony LCD television set with Sky digital and we have a king-sized water bed. But here’s my problem - I'm now sleeping with a 50 year old woman. You’re obviously not holding up your side of things and I don’t know what to do."

Ruth, being a very reasonable and sensible lady, says to Morris, "I’ve got a solution to your problem, Morris. Go out and find a sizzling 25 year old blonde. When you find one, I’ll make sure that you’ll once again be living in a small apartment, driving a cheap Ford, sleeping on a sofa bed, and watching a 15 inch black and white television set."

Jacob smiles with pride when he hears this. "It doesn’t really surprise me, Yetta," he says. "Haven’t I always told you how miraculous and powerful I am for you?"

"Yes, I know you have," replies Yetta, "but the way it works is like this - when I take your photo out of my handbag and look at your face, I say to myself, "What problem can there be that’s greater than this one?"

Isaac is 80 years old and goes to see doctor Myers for a full health check. After completing his tests, doctor Myers says to Isaac, "Well, for someone your age, everything seems very normal to me. But I’d like to ask you just one more question, Isaac. How is your sex life?"

"Well," replies Isaac, "it’s not really too bad, doctor. My wife isn’t really interested in sex any more, so I just drive around the streets of London once or twice a week. I’m really quite successful at finding one-night stands. For example, last week I picked up and made love to two young women."

"Oy, and at your age too," says doctor Myers. "I do hope Isaac that you took some precautions."

"Oh yes, doctor," replies Isaac, "I may be old, but I’m not senile yet. I gave both of them a phoney name."

### #1680 Memories

Joseph is thrilled to be taking Bracha, his 95year old mother to see the hit show, "Fiddler on the Roof." He’s excited not only because Bracha hasn’t seen it before, but also because she came to America in the late 1930s from one of the many Anatevka-like Russian shtetls.

Not only does Joseph book the most expensive seats in the theatre, but he also buys Bracha some smart new clothes to wear. And on the night of the show, he even orders a stretch limo to take them there and back. He wants it to be a memorable evening and doesn’t want to leave anything to chance.

On the night of the show, they arrive in style, take their seats and watch the performance. And as soon as the final curtain comes down, Joseph asks Bracha, "Well Mom, what did you think of the show? Be honest. Did it bring back any memories for you?"

Bracha sits there for a while, then turns to Joseph and gives both a nod and a classic JMS (Jewish Mother Shrug). "Yes bubbeleh, it did," she replies, "but I really don't remember that much singing."

### #1681 The rift

By chance, Esther meets her friend Becky in Brent Cross shopping centre. "Well fancy seeing you here," says Esther, "I haven’t seen you for at least a year. How’s everything?"

"Oh fine …. I suppose," replies Becky.

"What do you mean by ‘I suppose’?" asks Esther.

"Well," replies Becky, "my sister Rachel is very ill and is in hospital. I’ve just come back from visiting her."

"Oh, I’m sorry to hear it," says Esther. "Is Rachel the sister who’s not been speaking to you for some time?"

"Yes," replies Becky, "she fell out with me some 2 years ago and she hasn’t spoken a word to me since."

"So why did you visit her?" asks Esther.

"My sister Rachel is almost impossible to deal with," replies Becky. "When she’s broyges, she stays broyges, no matter what. But she’s very ill and my son Arnold begged me to go see her, and so I did."

"How did the visit go then?" asks Esther.

"As soon as I walked into her ward, she said to me, "Becky, don’t think that coming here automatically changes anything between us. Nevertheless, I want you to know that if I die, you're forgiven for all you've done to me. But, if I get well, please God, then I’ll stay broyges with you."

### #1683 The perfect woman

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Avrahom and Rivkah are quite worried about their 30 year old son Jacob. They’re a Chassidic family and they feel that Jacob should have found a wife by now and had many children. So one day, Avrahom announces, "I’ve been in touch with a shadchen to help us find a wife for our Jacob, and he’s coming here tonight."

"Oy vay," says Jacob.

The shadchen arrives and immediately starts asking questions to enable him to find the right kind of daughter / daughter-in-law. At the end of his visit, the shadchen says to them, "You’ve answered my questions and I’ve been able to put together a ‘shopping list’ of your requirements. I know what you want."

"So do you have someone who meets our requirements?" asks Avrahom, hopefully.

"I think I might have the perfect woman," replies the shadchen.  "I’ll be back tomorrow night with some news."

The next night, the shadchen returns and with a smile announces, "What a wonderful woman I’ve found."

"So make with the details, already," says Avrahom.

"Well," says the shadchen, "I think this woman will be perfect for Jacob. She’s the right age; she keeps a Glatt Kosher home; she attends shul regularly; she davens by heart; she just adores children and wants to raise a large family; she’s a marvellous cook; and on top of all that, she's very, very beautiful."

On hearing this, Avrahom and Rivkah begin to discuss the prospects of an early wedding. But then Jacob, who up to now has remained silent, asks the shadchen, "Is she also good in bed?"

The shadchen thinks for a moment, then replies, "Well Jacob, some say yes...and some say no."

### #1686 The telephone call

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Daniel, a single 40 year old, has just returned from a business trip to New York and is telling his friend Sam about a telephone conversation he had whilst there.

"What an embarrassing conversation it was," Daniel says.

"In what way was it embarrassing?" asks Sam.

"Well," replies Daniel, "Whenever I go on a business trip, I always pick up one of the cards left in various places that advertise girls willing to help men relax – you know what I mean, don’t you, Sam, massage and all that?"

"Yes, of course I know what ‘all that’ means," replies Sam with a wide smile on his face.

Daniel continues. "So as soon as I had checked into my hotel, I took out the card I found in my airport taxi. It was from a girl called, “SEXYLEGS” and believe me, Sam, the photo on the card was of a long legged beauty with great curves and a gorgeous smile kneeling on a bed. You know the kind, don’t you, Sam?"

"I sure do," replies Sam.

"So I'm in my room and I call her," continues Daniel. "‘Hello,’ the lady says to me, and Oy vay, did she sound sexy! I couldn’t wait to meet her so I said, ‘Hello, I understand that you give a wonderful massage and I'd like you to come to my room and give me one. But I also want more. Let me be honest with you - I've just arrived from London and I’m feeling horny. What I need badly is some sex. And I want it for the whole night. You name it, we'll do it, so bring all of your lotions, potions and toys with you and well have an all-night session to remember. You can even cover me with strawberries and cream. How does that grab you, darling?’"

"Wow," says Sam, "so what did she say to that?"

"She said, ‘That sounds pretty fantastic to me, but for an outside line you need to dial 9 first.’"

"Oh, that’s easy," replies Morris, "I just never disagree with anyone."

### #1688 Serious negotiation

In 1946, after many years of endeavour, Norman, Hymie and Maxwell Goldberg finally invent the first air-conditioning unit that can be fitted inside a car. So thrilled and confident are these three brothers that they decide to sell it to the largest car manufacturer in the world – Ford

They install their only working unit in one of their cars and choosing a hot day, drive to Ford’s Head Office in Detroit. On arrival, they ask to see Henry Ford himself, but as they don’t have an appointment, they have to use all their charm to persuade his secretary to help them. Within minutes, she’s telling Mr Ford that sitting in her office are three well dressed gentlemen with a most exciting invention that will help sell more Ford cars.

Henry Ford immediately asks them to join him in his office. But they refuse, asking him instead to go with them to the car park to see their invention. He agrees and when they reach the Goldberg’s car, all four get in. As it’s now very hot outside, the Goldbergs turn on their air-conditioning unit. Almost immediately the car begins to cool down. Henry Ford is very excited and asks if they have patented their invention – which they are pleased to confirm. So he invites them back to his office for some discussion.

One hour later, the Goldbergs are offered $3million for their invention. But they refuse. They not only want $5million but they also desire recognition by having a label on every one of their units saying, ‘A Goldberg Air-Conditioning unit.’

But Henry Ford says that there is no way he is going to put the name ‘Goldberg’ on millions of his Ford cars (everyone in America knows that he is more than a little bit anti-Semitic.) So they go back to haggling and eventually reach an agreement for the product. The offer now is $4.5million plus the display in each car of just the first names of the three brothers.

And so today all Ford air-conditioning units show their names on the air-conditioning controls as  "Norm"  "Hi"  "Max".

### #1690 It will be a mitzvah!

One day, as Judith is reaching inside her fridge for something for dinner, she notices a plastic-wrapped chicken right at the back, on the bottom shelf. She removes it from the fridge and she’s not happy with what she sees. This is a chicken she bought many weeks ago and has forgotten about. It’s looking very ragged and unappetising - even a bit smelly. But just as she's about to throw it in the bin, her husband Harry stops her.

"Don’t do that," says Harry. "Our neighbour Bernie has been out of work for months and he and his family probably haven’t had a roast chicken meal for ages. I think you should give him the chicken."

"But it's no good, it’s probably gone off," says Judith.

"It doesn't matter," says Harry, "just do it. It will be a mitzvah!"

So Judith gives the chicken to her next door neighbour. But then, two days later, they learn that Bernie is terribly sick and has been taken to the local hospital.

"We must go to the hospital right away," says Harry, "and pay Bernie a visit – it will be a mitzvah!"

The day following their visit, they learn that Bernie has died.

"Oy gevalt," cries Judith, "what on earth shall we do, Harry?"

"What shall we do?" Harry replies, "We shall go to Bernie’s levoyah, that’s what. It will be a mitzvah!"

Two days after attending Bernie’s levoyah, Harry says, "Judith, we've got to pay a visit to Bernie’s family while they’re sitting shivah. It will be a mitzvah!"

So Judith and Bernie go next door to join the family in prayers for the loss of their husband and father. By the time they return home, Judith is crying.  "Harry," she sobs, "don’t you think it was wrong of us to give Bernie that old chicken?"

"You must be joking, Judith," replies Harry. "From that one old chicken, we got ourselves four mitzvahs!"

### #1695 The kosher hotel booking

One day, Cyril notices for the first time that his father Nathan is getting on in years and decides to treat him. When next he visits his father, Cyril says, "Dad, I’ve done well in business and I’d like to treat you. You haven’t been on holiday since Mum died and I think it’s time you went again. So I’m going to purchase a return flight to Miami Beach and book you into a nice hotel. I’m sure you’ll meet lots of new friends and the weather there will do you good. What do you say?"

"Oy, son, what a nice present," replies Nathan. "I’d love to go, but only on condition that you book me into a strictly kosher hotel."

"It’s a deal," says Cyril.

Cyril quickly makes arrangements for his father to stay 6 weeks at the ‘Kosher Minky Hotel’. Two weeks later, he takes his father to the airport and sees him off.

Every Sunday for the next four weeks, Cyril phones his father to check all is well. And the reply is always, "You didn’t need to call me, son, I’m well and I’m thoroughly enjoying myself."

But Cyril wants to see his father’s happiness for himself and decides to visit the Kosher Minky without telling anyone. When he arrives, he looks for his father in the lounges, the dining room and the swimming pool, but there is no sign of him. So he goes to reception and asks where he might find his father. The receptionist tells him that he should try the Goodservice Hotel, room 13.

Cyril immediately takes a taxi to the Goodservice, walks up to room 13 and knocks on the door. The door is opened by a tarty looking girl in her underwear, and there behind her is his father in a bathrobe.

"Father," shouts Cyril, "how could you? You’re a religious man and you made me book you into a kosher hotel. I’m totally shocked by what I see."

Nathan looks at his son and says, "I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up for, son. I don’t eat here."

### #1696 How do the dentures feel?

Abe’s eating a bagel for his mid morning snack and breaks his dentures. He searches Yellow Pages for a dental technician, but everyone he calls quotes him an exorbitant price. "I just don’t understand you, Abe," says his wife Sarah, "we have a newly qualified dentist in the family, so why don't you call your nephew Arnold? I know you don’t think much of him, but I’ll bet he’ll give you a better deal than those gonifs you’ve just spoken to. Why don’t you go see him, he’s only five minutes away?"

"Oy Vay, Sarah," replies Abe, "You know I think Arnold is a shmuck. I wouldn't want to put any dentures he makes in my mouth."

But Sarah doesn’t let up and 30 minutes later, Abe is discussing new dentures with Arnold. "I can make you a new set for only £100," says Arnold, "which is a special rate just for the family."

A week later, Abe has his first fitting and just as he thought, they’re uncomfortable. Over the weeks that follow, Abe regularly visits Arnold for adjustments. Sometimes Arnold adds some material, sometimes he grinds away some material and sometimes he bends some material, but to no avail - Abe never feels they fit perfectly.  Then suddenly Abe stops coming and Arnold thinks he is at last happy with his dentures.

Two months later, by chance, they meet in the street. "Hi uncle Abe," Arnold says, "it's good to see you again. How do the dentures feel?"

"Let me answer that by telling you a true story," replies Abe. "For the past three weeks, we’ve been on a Caribbean Cruise. Whilst there, I hire a boat to do some deep water fishing and immediately I hook this great big 350 pound tuna. This is a very powerful fish and immediately begins to swim away from me. As I’m struggling to hold him, my 200 metres fishing line runs out and I’m nearly jerked over the side. Then the tuna turns around and starts swimming back towards me at great speed and now I’m frantically reeling in the line. Then I notice that somehow the loose line which has been falling in the boat has wrapped itself around my shorts, trapping my testicles. Before I can take any action, the tuna turns around for a second time and starts swimming even faster away from the boat. Arnold, believe me, just then, for the first time in many, many weeks, I didn't feel your dentures!"

### #1705 The Pope and the Rabbi

[Author unknown]

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He would have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy, if the Pope won, they would have to leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged but wise Rabbi Moshe, to represent them in the debate. However, as Moshe spoke no Italian and the Pope spoke no Yiddish, they all agreed that it would be a "silent" debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and Rabbi Moshe sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Rabbi Moshe looked back and raised one finger.

Next the Pope waved his finger around his head. Rabbi Moshe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. Rabbi Moshe pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared that he was beaten, that Rabbi Moshe was too clever and that the Jews could stay.

Later, the Cardinals met with the Pope, asking what had happened. The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had me beaten and I could not continue."

Meanwhile the Jewish community were gathered around Rabbi Moshe. "How did you win the debate?" they asked.

"I haven't a clue," said Moshe. "First he said to me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I said to him, ‘up yours!’ Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews and I said to him, we're staying right here."

"And then what," asked a woman.

"Who knows?" said Moshe, "He took out his lunch so I took out mine."

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Young Benny arrives home from school and says to his mother, "Mummy, when daddy was taking me to school on the bus this morning, he asked me to give up my seat to a lady who was standing next to us. So I did. But do you think I should have given up my seat?"

"Well Benny," replies his mother, "I think it was a very nice thing to do. I always appreciate someone giving up their seat for me when all the seats are taken."

"I know that, mummy," says Benny, "but I was sitting on daddy’s lap at the time."

### #1714 Marriage

Rivkah awakens one night to find that her husband Howard is not in bed with her. She goes downstairs to look for him and finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in front of him. He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes away a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee.

"What's the matter, dear?" she asks tenderly, "why are you down here in the middle of the night?"

Howard looks up from his coffee. "Do you remember, Rivkah, how young we both were when we first started dating?"

"Yes, I remember," Rivkah replies.

Howard’s voice is brimming with emotion. "Do you also remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car making love?"

"How could I forget?" says Rivkah.

"And do you remember he put a gun against my head and said, 'Either you marry my daughter or I'll see to it that you go to jail for 30 years?'"

"I remember that well," Rivkah softly replies, taking hold of his hand.

Howard wipes away a tear and says, "I would have got out today."

Harry turns to Kitty and asks, "OK for me to reply to this?"

Kitty replies, "Yes dear."

"Well," continues Harry, "our secret is quite simple. On the very day we got married, Kitty and I came to an agreement which we’ve stuck to all these years. We decided that I would make all the major decisions and Kitty would make all the minor decisions. And I can truthfully say that over the 60 years of our marriage, I have never needed to make a major decision."

### #1723 The baseball lesson

David from England is visiting his friend Stan in America. One of the first things Stan does is to invite David to a baseball game. Soon after the game starts, the first player hits a single and runs to first base. The next batter is a dangerous batter, so they decide to walk him.

David is very confused to see this and says to Stan, "I don't understand what’s happening, Stan. Why did the first player run to first base, whereas this last one just walked to first base?"

"It’s really simple, David," replies Stan. "That’s because he got a walk - he had four balls."

"Oh now I understand," says David. "Having that is enough to slow any man down!"

It’s dinner time and Jeremy is finding it hard to get through his chicken soup. To be honest, he really doesn’t much like its taste or consistency. His wife Sarah sees her Jeremy struggling with it and so asks him, "What’s wrong with the soup, Jeremy?"

"Although you’re the best cook in the world, darling," replies Jeremy, "when it comes to chicken soup, you’ve got a lot to learn. I don’t want to upset you, but I just don’t like your soup. My mother Miriam makes the best chicken soup in the world. Why don’t you ask her for her recipe?"

"Oy vay, Jeremy," replies Sarah, "you know how Miriam hates me. She would never tell me such a thing."

"But your mother Hetty also makes an excellent chicken soup," says Jeremy. "Surely she must have told you how."

"Jeremy," says Sarah, "This was the recipe she gave me. I guess Hetty hates you just as much as Miriam hates me."

Miriam gets married and a year later goes into hospital and gives birth to triplets. All her family and friends are shocked when they hear the news – they know of no-one who has had triplets before.

As soon as she hears the news, Miriam’s shviger Fay goes to visit her daughter-in-law in hospital. As soon as she arrives, Fay hands over the bunch of grapes and says, "What a surprise, Miriam. No one on our side of the family has ever had twins before, yet alone triplets."

"Yes, it was a bit of a shock," replies Miriam, "but I’m getting over it. In fact my doctor tells me that triplets only happen once every hundred thousand times."

"Oy vay, Miriam," says Fay, "how on earth did you find the time to do your housework?"

### #1726 The marriage

[My thanks to Norm K for the following]

Lionel from London is taking his University gap year in America and he’s visiting as many places there as he can. But whilst spending some time in Oklahoma, he meets and falls deeply in love with a Cherokee girl. Not long after, they decide to get married and Lionel rings his mother to tell her the good news.

"Mum, I’ve found my future wife and we’re getting married over here. I’m going to send you the air tickets to join us."

"Mazeltov Lionel," his mother says. "I’m so pleased, but is she ……. Jewish?"

"No mum," Lionel replies, "she’s not. But she promises to act as a Jewish wife."

"Oy," his mother wails, "I’ve always wanted you to marry a lovely Jewish girl."

"You can’t have everything mum," Lionel says. "And another thing I must tell you. She lives on a reservation and that’s where we’ll be living after we marry."

"I can’t take any more of this," cries his mother, "I don’t want the tickets and I don’t want to speak to you again." And with that she slams down the phone.

Almost a year later, Lionel rings his mother and tells her that they are expecting a baby.  His mother doesn’t slam down the phone but says, very politely and unemotionally, "That’s nice, son, I’m happy for you both."

Eight months later, Lionel again rings his mother and says, "Mum, I just want to say that last night my wife gave birth to a beautiful, healthy baby boy. I also want you to know that we’ve agreed to give our son a Jewish name."

Upon hearing this unexpected news, his mother shouts out with happiness. "Oh Lionel, bubbeleh, this is wonderful news," she cries, "I've been waiting for this moment all my life. You’ve both made me more happy than you could ever know."

"That's fantastic, mum," replies Lionel. "I’m so glad that you and I are back together as mother and son."

"And what," asks his proud and happy mother, "is my lovely grandson’s name going to be?"

Lionel replies, proudly, "Smoked Whitefish."

Ethel, a little old lady with a lovely smile, makes a living selling roses on the corner of Middlesex Street for £1 a rose. Maurice, on the other hand, works for a bank in Middlesex Street and is doing very well for himself.

Maurice has always felt sorry for Ethel and whenever he leaves his office for lunch and passes Ethel, he always gives her £1. But Maurice never takes a rose from her and although this has been going on for 2 years, the two of them have never spoken to each other.

One day, as Maurice passes Ethel and leaves his usual £1, Ethel speaks to him for the first time. "I appreciate your business, sir. You really are my best customer, but I must point out to you that the price of a rose has now gone up to £1.50."

### #1730 The doctor’s advice

[My thanks to Ron for the following]

Right up to the time he gets married to the lovely Hannah, Avrahom had never been with a girl before. So it’s not surprising that on his wedding night, poor Avrahom can’t do anything right for Hannah. Two weeks go by and he still doesn’t really know what to do in bed. Totally frustrated, Hannah suggests to Avrahom that he has a chat with their doctor. He agrees and two days later he’s talking to Dr Myers.

"So what should I do, doctor?" asks Avrahom.

"It’s quite simple, Avrahom," advises Dr Myers. "Next time you’re in bed with Hannah, you should place your hand gently on her stomach and say something like, ‘darling, I love you so much’ and everything will be OK from that moment onwards."

Avrahom goes home feeling more confident.

Later that night, soon after they get into bed, Avrahom places his hand on her stomach and says in a very romantic voice, "Darling, I love you with all my heart and I always will."

Hannah can’t believe the change in Avrahom and decides to take things further, so excitedly she whispers back, "Lower Avrahom, lower."

So our Avrahom repeats, but this time in a much lower voice, "Darling, I love you with all my heart ………"

### #1731 Designs for senior citizens

Miriam has never been on a cruise before. One day, she meets her friend Leah and they stop for a chat.

"So where are you and Simon going for your holidays this year?" asks Leah.

"I’d like to try out a cruise, Leah," replies Miriam, "but I’m not sure whether Simon and I would enjoy ourselves. We’re almost 70 now and Simon thinks cruising is for younger people."

"No, you’re wrong in thinking that, Miriam," replies Leah. "Most cruise ships have special design features just for senior citizens."

"So give me an example, already," says Miriam.

"Well … OK," replies Leah, "They have bifocal portholes."

In 1967, Isaac joins the Army. On his first day of service, he gets issued with a comb and later on in the afternoon, the Army hairdresser cuts off all his lovely thick brown hair. Isaac is not at all happy with this. His hair was his pride and joy.

On Isaac’s second day of service, he gets issued with a toothbrush and later on in the afternoon, the Army dentist extracts four of his teeth. Isaac is very angry with this as he felt these teeth were perfectly sound.

On Isaac’s third day of service, he gets issued with a jock strap.

Forty years later, the Army is still searching for Isaac.

"With marks like these," replies Sidney, "and you still felt like singing?"

### #1735 A few kind words

Moshe walks into the bar at his golf club, sits down and orders a whisky. As he sips his drink, he hears a soothing voice say, "Nice tie, Moshe."

He looks around but notices that there is no-one else in the room except for himself and the barman. A few sips later, another voice says, "Beautiful shirt, Moshe."

Moshe calls over the bartender. "I must be losing my mind," he says. "I keep hearing voices saying nice things to me yet there's no-one in here except the two of us."

"It's the peanuts, Moshe," says the barman, smiling.

"What on earth are you talking about? Are you meshugga?" says Moshe.

"It's the peanuts," repeats the barman, "they're complimentary."

### #1736 A miracle?

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Rabbi Levy, one of the wisest of rabbis, is dying. And because he is so loved by his colleagues, many rabbis have gathered around his hospital bedside trying to make his last moments as rewarding as possible.

Whilst the visiting rabbis are praying, one of the nurses comes into the room and offers rabbi Levy a glass of warm milk to drink. But with what little strength he has left, rabbi Levy refuses it.

Seeing this, rabbi Jacobs has an idea. He remembers that he has a bottle of whiskey in his car which he was planning to use for his next kiddush. So whilst his colleagues are watching rabbi Levy’s laboured breaths, he quickly picks up the glass of milk and creeps out to his car. Rabbi Jacobs then opens the bottle of whiskey and pours a generous portion of it into the warm milk. He then goes back to rabbi Levy’s bedside and holds the glass to rabbi Levy’s lips.

"Go on rabbi Levy," says rabbi Jacobs, "please drink some of this milk. It will make you feel a bit better. Really it will."

So rabbi Levy takes a small sip, stares at the glass, drinks a bit more, then smiles and finishes every drop of the milk-and-whiskey mixture.

The other rabbis are humbled when they see rabbi Levy apparently making some kind of recovery. "Rabbi Levy," they say, "please share some of your wisdom with us before you die!"

At this, rabbi Levy raises himself up in his bed and with a pious look on his face points out the window and says, "Don't sell that cow!"

### #1737 Reminiscing

Ruth, Hetty and Naomi, all three in their 80s, are sitting together in their retirement home reminiscing about the good old days. Ruth says, "I remember when I used to be able to buy lovely big cucumbers at the greengrocers for no more than 1p each. They were giants (she demonstrates their length and thickness with her hands as she talks), not like the little cucumbers on sale today."

Hetty then says, "Well I remember the giant onions I used to be able to buy for ½ p each. Every week, I always bought two of them (and she demonstrates the size of the two onions with her hands as she talks) for my chicken soup."

Naomi, who has been sitting quietly listening to Ruth and Hetty, then says, "I couldn’t hear a word either of you were saying, but I remember the guy you were talking about."

### #1738 Hebonics

[My thanks to Richard K for the following]

The New York City school board has officially declared Jewish English - now dubbed Hebonics - as a second language. Backers of the move say the city's School District is the first in the state to recognize Hebonics as a valid language and significant attribute of New York culture. According to Howard Schollman, linguistics professor at New York University and renowned Hebonics scholar, the sentence structure of Hebonics derives from middle and eastern European language patterns, as well as Yiddish.

Prof. Schollman explains, "In Hebonics, the response to any question is usually another question -- plus a complaint that is implied or stated. Thus, 'How are you?' may be answered, 'How should I be, with my feet?'"

Schollman says that Hebonics is a superb linguistic vehicle for expressing sarcasm or skepticism.  An example is the repetition of a word with "sh" or "shm" at the beginning: "Mountains, shmountains. Stay away. You want a nosebleed?"

Another Hebonics pattern is moving the subject of a sentence to the end, with its pronoun at the beginning: "It's beautiful, that dress."

Schollman says one also sees the Hebonics verb moved to the end of the sentence. Thus the response to a remark such as: "He's slow as a turtle," could be: "Turtle, shmurtle! Like a fly in Vaseline, he walks."

Schollman provided the following examples from his textbook, Switched-On Hebonics:

### #1740 The mensh of Golders Green

Bernie is walking down Golders Green Road one cold morning when he hears an almighty crash behind him. He turns around and sees a "Golders Green’s Best Kosher Wines" lorry lying on its side, with broken bottles all around it and wine freely running into the gutter. The driver didn’t seem to be injured, but he was nevertheless weeping openly. A crowd quickly gathers around the incident.

"What’s the matter?" Bernie asks the driver, "Are you hurting somewhere?"

"No, I’m not hurt," replies the driver, "but my boss, Mr Solly, will no doubt blame me for the loss of his wine and deduct its cost from my pay packet."

On hearing this, a man suddenly steps forward and says to the crowd, "Oy vay, did you hear what this poor hard working Jewish guy has just said? He said he’s going to lose a lot of money as a result of this accident. We shouldn’t let this happen. We must all rally around and help him out."

At that, he takes off his hat, puts it on the ground next to the driver and places a £5 note in it. "Nu? What are you all waiting for?" he says to the crowd. "Help this man out. It will be a mitzvah."

Soon, the hat is overflowing with notes and coins. The man then picks up the hat and money, gives it to the driver and smiling, says, "Here, this will help you. Go back to your office and give this to your boss. It will keep him happy." As the man walks away, Bernie says to the driver, "Wow! I must tell The Jewish Chronicle of this incident. What a mensh that man is - have you ever seen him before?"

"Of course," replies the driver. "That’s my boss Mr Solly."

The Levine Bros tailor shop is going through a difficult period and the two partners, Harry and Sidney, are having a chat about their future prospects. Harry says, "Oy, Sidney, things are not so hot. It seems that the only chance we have to prosper is if the Messiah comes."

"Why do you think the Messiah would help us?" asks Sidney.

"Because," replies Harry, "he would bring the dead back to life."

"Nu?" asks Sidney. "So how would that help us?"

"Because they would all need new clothes, wouldn’t they?" replies Harry.

"But what if some of them had been tailors before they died?" asks Sidney. "Wouldn’t they be competing with us?"

"Don’t be a shmuck, Sidney," replies Harry, "they wouldn’t know this year’s new styles!"

### #1745 Zaydeh’s visit

[My thanks to Yvonne B for the following]

85 year old Jacob from New York is visiting his grandson David in Edgware. "It’s nice of you to put me up, David," says Jacob. "I’ll be no trouble to you. My memory is going fast and I can’t walk too far, so all I need do is sit somewhere and maybe watch TV. But promise me you’ll take me to shul on shabbes."

"Of course I will, zaydeh," replies David.

Shabbes arrives and so that they don’t have to walk too far, David takes his grandfather to the nearest Edgware shul. But David doesn’t tell him that this is a reform shul, even though he knows his grandfather is strictly Orthodox.

During the service, the rabbi gives a sermon on the evils of adultery. Jacob turns to David and whispers, "So tell me already bubbeleh, what means this word adultery?"

As quick as a flash and to avoid any embarrassment, David whispers back, "the best way that I can describe it zaydeh is that adultery means that you mustn’t turn on any electricity in the house on shabbes."

At the end of the service, as they were leaving the shul, Jacob shuffles over to the rabbi and says, "Oy, that was a really important speech you made today on adultery. It was zer gut - obber meer hobben for das a shicksa."

### #1746 The Mummy Test

Hannah is out walking in the park with her young daughter Emma when she sees Emma pick something up from the ground and put it in her mouth. "Emma," she shouts out loud, "spit that out at once."

Emma does as she’s told, then asks, "Why can’t I put it in my mouth, mummy?"

"Because it will make you ill, darling," replies Hannah. "As it’s been on the ground, it’s got dirty, so it’s full of germs which will make you very sick."

Emma looks admiringly at her mother and asks, "You’re so, so clever, mummy. How do you know all these things?"

"All mummies know these things, darling," replies Hannah. "It’s what we have to learn before we can take the MUMMY TEST. If you don’t pass this test, they don’t let you be a mummy."

"Oh, so does this mean that if you don’t pass the test, you have to be the daddy instead?" asks Emma.

"That’s exactly right, darling," Hannah replies with a big grin.

### #1747 Clever thinking doctor

Moshe is 80 years old and is in doctor Myers’ office discussing the results of his recent medical check-up. Doctor Myers finishes looking at the cardiogram and says, "Mazeltov, Moshe. I’m pleased to be able to tell you that your health is absolutely A1. You have good lungs, your blood pressure is fine for someone your age, and this cardiogram shows that your heart will go on beating for many more years yet. So come back in 2 years time and I’ll give you another check-up."

Moshe shakes the doctor’s hand and says, "Thanks doctor, I was worried about my health before I came here, so I’m glad all is OK." He then leaves.

But within seconds of Moshe leaving the office, doctor Myers hears a loud thump from the reception area. He rushes out and to his horror sees Moshe lying flat on his back next to the reception desk. He checks Moshe and quickly discovers that Moshe is dead. "Oy veh, what happened?" doctor Myers asks his receptionist.

"He walked past me then fell stiffly backwards to the floor, just like a tree being felled," she replies.

Doctor Myers bends down, puts his hands under Moshe’s arms and says to the receptionist, "grab hold of his feet for me please."

"Why do you want me to do that?" she asks. "Shouldn’t we leave him as he is for the ambulance men to take?"

"No, definitely not," replies doctor Myers. "We must turn him around right now."

"Why?" asks the receptionist.

"To make it look like he was coming in," replies doctor Myers.

Louis runs a little shop selling a mishmosh of small items which he buys cheap and sells cheap. One day Leah visits the shop and as she is looking around, she spots a small lace fan. It’s very hot outside, so she picks it up and walks to the till to pay. "How much is this fan?" Leah asks Louis.

"For you, lady," replies Louis, you can have it for 50p"

"OK," says Leah and pays the money.

Next morning, Leah is back in the shop. She shows Louis the remnants of the fan and says, "I had only been using the fan for a short while when it just seemed to fall to pieces."

"So?" asks Louis.

"So I want my money back," says Leah.

"How much did you pay for it?" asks Louis.

"50p," replies Leah.

"And how did you use it?" asks Louis.

"Oy, what a stupid question," replies Leah. "Do you think I’m meshugga? I waved it in front of my face from side to side, as I always do."

"Well no wonder it broke," says Louis. "That’s what you do with a £5 fan. With a 50p fan, you hold the fan still in front of your face and wave your head. "

"What condition is that?" asks Arnold, looking a bit worried.

"On condition that the hand you’re asking for," replies the father with a mischievous grin, "is the hand that’s always in my pocket."

Jacob and Morris meet in Brent Cross Shopping Centre for their regular weekly schmooze and coffee. But this time, they just sit there staring at their cups of coffee without saying a word. Suddenly, Jacob says, "Do you know what I think, Morris?"

"No," replies Morris, "what is it that you think, Jacob?"

"I think," says Jacob, "that life is just like a cup of coffee."

"Why do you think that?" asks Morris.

"How should I know," replies Jacob. "Am I a philosopher?"

### #1751 The first date

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Judith meets Isaac at a dance and they seem to hit it off quite nicely – so much so that they agree to go out for a meal the following night. Isaac says he will pick her up at her house at 8pm.

The following evening, Judith spends quality time getting herself ready for what she hopes will be the start of a new romance. Finally, she is ready. She walks over to the mirror and looks at herself. What she sees is an attractive, sexy, well made-up young woman, wearing a low-cut but very chic evening dress, matching satin shoes, and the vintage pearl necklace and matching ear-rings her bubbeh gave her. She is pleased with what she sees and sits down to wait for Isaac.

But she is very disappointed when 8pm arrives and there’s no sign of him. She continues to wait in hope, but there’s still no Isaac. At 9.30pm, Judith gives up. Crying, she runs upstairs to the bathroom and roughly wipes off all her make-up, smudging her lipstick over her mouth. But she doesn’t care. She goes into her bedroom, changes out of her lovely dress and puts on her dressing gown. Finally, she takes off her shoes, puts on her slippers and goes downstairs to watch TV.

But as soon as she sits down, the doorbell rings. When Judith opens it, there stands Isaac with a bunch of flowers in his hand. He looks at Judith with a worried look on his face and says to her, "Judith, what’s going on? I’m nearly two hours late, …. and you’re still not ready?"

### #1752 The invoice query

Lionel has been seeing Dr Myers, his psychiatrist, for some weeks now for his schizophrenia and eventually receives an invoice for the first month’s treatment. But when he reads it, he is shocked – it’s for £1,000. He immediately phones Dr Myers.

"Doctor," Lionel says, "I’ve just got your bill for £1,000. I thought you told me your charge is £500 per month."

"But my dear Lionel," replies Dr Myers, "it is £500 per month   ….. but for each, don’t forget."

### #1753 The premonition

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Judith picks a firm of solicitors from the Yellow Pages and makes an appointment to see someone from their Family department.

"How can I help you, madam?" asks the solicitor.

"Is it true," asks Judith, "that if I get divorced, I'm entitled to 50% of all of my husband's possessions?"

"Well," the solicitor replies, "the law firm would get their fee, of course, but even after this payment, it is usually the case that the woman ends up receiving at least 50%, maybe a bit more, of her husband’s entire assets. So tell me, are you ready for a divorce at this moment?"

"Oh no," replies Judith, "I need to find a husband first."

Aaron and Renee are driving back from a short holiday when their car is involved in a minor accident. Aaron wasn’t concentrating and he hits a parked car. Fortunately, no one is hurt. Within minutes a police officer arrives at the scene.

"So what happened?" the officer asks Aaron, smiling. "How did you manage to hit that car? It couldn’t have been easy."

Aaron immediately replies, "It was mine Renee’s fault."

"Why do you say that?" asks the officer, making notes.

"Because," replies Aaron, "she fell asleep in the back seat."

### #1755 The cancellation

Freda is getting worried. Her husband Bernie walked out of their house earlier that day and hasn’t returned. At 9pm she goes to her local police station to report a missing person.

While she’s giving details to the officer in charge, she gives him a photo of Bernie and says, "When you find him, could you please tell him that my mother didn’t come after all. She decided she would stay the week at my brother’s house instead."

### #1756 The arrival

Sadie has died and today is her levoyah. Her husband Nathan and many of their family and friends are standing round the grave as Sadie’s coffin is lowered into the ground. Then, as is the custom, many of the mourners pick up some spades and help to fill the open grave with earth.

But on their way back to the prayer hall, the sky suddenly darkens, rain starts to fall, flashes of lightening fill the sky and loud thunder claps batter their ears.

Nathan turns to his rabbi and says, "Well rabbi, she’s arrived OK."

### #1757  The drive to school

David is driving his ten year old granddaughter Emma to school one morning when he accidentally hits his car’s horn.

Emma looks at him and asks, "Why did you toot your horn, grandpa David?"

"I didn’t mean to do it, Emma," David says. "I hit the horn by mistake."

"I knew it must have been a mistake, grandpa," says Emma, "because you didn't say ‘shmuck’ afterwards."

### #1758 STOP PRESS:

[My thanks to Simon T for the following]

It’s true! In an old cookbook, there’s a recipe for "Roast Neck of Lamb" that begins with: -

"Wipe neck with a damp cloth."

### #1759 The expert insurance agent

Gary has had a tremendous year selling life assurance policies and is asked by one of his colleagues for the secret to his success. Gary replies, "After I outline the benefits of life assurance, I go into costs. And if the prospect then seems to be undecided, I say to him, ‘OK, I understand that you might need some time to think it over, so why don’t you sleep on it. Then let me know what you think tomorrow morning - if you wake up, that is.’"

### #1760 The sermon switchover

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

In order to improve local community spirit, two rabbis of nearby shuls agree to give a shabbes sermon to each other’s congregation. This week it is Rabbi Bloom’s turn.

At the appointed time, Rabbi Bloom turns up at the other shul, but immediately sits down. The congregation wait patiently for him to get up and begin his sermon, but Rabbi Bloom just sits there staring at the floor. After 5 minutes of waiting, the shammes goes over to the rabbi and asks, "My dear rabbi, what are you waiting for? Everyone’s waiting to hear from you."

Pointing to his mouth, Rabbi Bloom quietly replies, "I can’t talk properly. By mistake, I’ve left my false teeth in my bathroom at home."

"Don’t worry, rabbi," says the shammes, "I know where you live. It’s only round the corner. Give me your keys and I’ll get your teeth for you."

Five minutes later, the shammes returns and gives the rabbi his teeth. Rabbi Bloom then gets up and starts his sermon. He talks and he talks and oh how he talks. And the annoying thing is that he’s talking about nothing in particular. After 15 minutes of this, the congregation start to get a bit bothered. But Rabbi Bloom just keeps talking, almost without a pause.

When some members of the shul start to get up to leave, the shammes quickly goes over to the rabbi and says, "Excuse me for interrupting your sermon, rabbi, but it’s getting late and many here need to get home. So why are you talking so much?"

"I can’t help it," replies Rabbi Bloom. "You brought me my wife’s false teeth by mistake."

### #1761 The dry cleaners

Fay is fuming with anger as she enters her dry cleaners carrying a piece of laundry in her arms. She goes straight to the manager and says, "I’ve just had this cleaned by you and just look at how you returned it. And you have the chutzpah to advertise that you are the Number One dry cleaners in London!"

The manager looks it over and says, "It seems OK to me, madam. I can’t see anything wrong with the way we cleaned this lace tablecloth."

"Don’t be such a shmo," says Fay. "This was a sheet from my bed."

### #1762 Lessons in business

[My thanks to Ron for the following]

Isaac’s wealthy parents stop at nothing to ensure that their son’s barmitzvah is one their family and friends will remember for a long time. So Isaac reads his barmitzvah piece in front of a ‘full house’ at the St John’s Wood Synagogue, followed on the Sunday by a tremendous barmitzvah party at the Ritz Hotel which goes on well past midnight.

The next day, Isaac doesn’t wake up until mid morning. He opens his tired eyes and there, waiting by his bedside, is his father. "Hi Dad," says Isaac, "is anything the matter?"

"Not at all, son," replies his father. "It’s just that now you are of age, I feel today is a good time to start teaching you how to survive in business."

"Oh dad," says Isaac, "do we really have to? I’m so tired."

"Yes we do," replies his father, "it won’t take long."

Isaac watches his father leave his bedroom and then return with a decorator’s two-legged step-ladder. His father opens up the ladder in the middle of the bedroom floor and says, "OK Isaac, all you need do is climb up to the top."

"But it’s too wobbly, dad," says Isaac. "I might fall and hurt myself."

"There’s no need to worry," says his father. "Nothing will happen. I will hold it steady for you."

So Isaac walks over to the ladder and starts to climb, one slow step at a time and when he reaches the top he begins to smile a bit. All of a sudden his father pushes the ladder over and Isaac takes a nasty fall, hitting his head on the wardrobe.

Rubbing his head vigorously, Isaac shouts at his father, "Why on earth did you do that, dad? You could have killed me."

"It’s OK Isaac," replies his father, "this was the first and most important business lesson of many I will be teaching you - ’Trust No One'."

### #1763 In the know

Freda and Kitty are having their usual chat when Kitty suddenly asks, "I’m very embarrassed to be asking you this, Freda, but you are my best friend and I know you will keep this to yourself. It’s very personal."

"Of course I will, Kitty," says Freda, "I know when to keep shtoom. So what do you want to ask me?"

"How does one go about starting an affair?" asks Kitty, going red in the face.

"You’ve asked the right person, Kitty. I’ve had experience you know," says Freda. "I always start mine with Hava Negila."

### #1764 The lost wallet

As happens quite frequently these days, Morris gets into a dreadful state of panic. He rushes up to his wife Leah and says, almost crying, "I can’t find my wallet. I’ve been looking for it everywhere. What should I do? I had over £200 in it, and all my credit cards."

"Calm down Morris," replies Leah, "we just came back from shopping at Costco, so did you look in your jacket?"

"Yes, of course I did," replies Morris, "do you think I’m a shmo? I’ve looked in my jacket’s inside pockets three times already and it’s not there."

"So what about your trouser pockets?" asks Leah.

"I’ve looked in there too," replies Morris, "but my wallet isn’t in either pocket. What shall I do, Leah?  What shall I do?"

"Oh stop whining Morris," says Leah. "What about the side pockets of your jacket? Have you checked your wallet isn’t in there?"

"I’m not meshugga yet, Leah," Morris cries. "Of course I haven’t looked in my jacket’s side pockets. Why should I give up the last bit of hope I have left?"

### #1765 A student’s saychel

During his school holidays, 17 year-old Avrahom decides to take a temporary job as a delivery boy for Minky’s Restaurant. One evening he delivers a meal to Bernie’s house. He hands over the meal and Bernie pays the bill. Then Bernie looks at Avrahom for a few seconds and somewhat begrudgingly says, "I suppose you also want me to give you a tip?"

Avrahom doesn’t answer immediately, but looks at Bernie for a few seconds before replying. "Yes, sir, that would be most appreciated, especially as the guy who normally delivers to this area told me that I shouldn’t expect much from you. He said I should be thankful if I got 10p."

"Well," says Bernie, "just to prove your friend wrong, here’s £2 for your efforts."

"Thank you very much," says Avrahom. "This will go into the fund I’m building up to pay for my future education."

"Really?" says Bernie. "So what are you going to study?"

"Applied Psychology," replies Avrahom.

### #1766 Calculating error

Jonathan has a terrible toothache and goes to see Arnold, his dentist. After looking at the tooth, Arnold says, "I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but the tooth is badly decayed and can’t be saved. It will have to come out."

"Oy vay," says Jonathan, "how much is it going to cost me?"

"For you, "replies Arnold, "only £125."

"That’s rather a high charge just for maybe 5 minutes work," says Jonathan.

"Well," replies Arnold, "if that’s how you calculate the cost of high quality dental work, I can always extract it much slower for you."

### #1767 Double trouble

"Oy, it’s tough getting old," says Sam to his friend Hymie. "If it’s not one problem, then it’s another. As soon as I awoke this morning, I had two shocks, one after the other."

"So what happened, Sam?" asks Hymie.

"When I woke up," replies Sam, "I thought my water bed had broken."

"Well had it?" asks Hymie.

"No, it hadn’t," replies Sam.

"Well that was alright then," says Hymie. "So what was your second shock?"

"I remembered that I didn’t have a water bed," Sam replies.

### #1768 Her love of chicken soup

Rivkah loves her chicken soup. She always makes a full saucepan’s worth every week for herself and her husband Shlomo. She just never tires of having it.  One night, while her Shlomo is out playing poker with his friends, she heats up a bowl of her chicken soup and starts to tuck into it, smiling with every spoonful. But then her front doorbell rings. It’s Benjy and Jeremy, two of her husband’s friends. She invites them in and then continues drinking her chicken soup.

"Oy vay, Rivkah," says Benjy, almost crying.

"So what’s the matter?" asks Rivkah.

"We’re so sorry to have to tell you this, Rivkah," replies Jeremy, "but Shlomo has just been knocked down by a car near my house. He was on his way home from our poker night."

"So is he badly hurt?" Rivkah asks, still drinking her chicken soup.

"I’m afraid it’s bad news," replies Benjy. "Shlomo is …… he’s dead."

Rivah continues drinking her chicken soup.

"Rivkah," says Jeremy, "Do you hear what we’re saying to you? Your Shlomo has been killed."

Rivkah continues spooning chicken soup into her mouth.

"I don’t understand why you are taking our terrible news so calmly," says Benjy.

"Don’t worry," says Rivkah. "As soon as I finish my bowl of chicken soup, are you going to hear a scream."

### #1769 The timetable

Harry is out shopping at Brent Cross Shopping Centre and meets his old friend Bernard. After telling each other how they’ve been getting on over the years, Harry asks Bernard whether he’s free for a poker game on Saturday evening.

"Sorry, I can’t," says Bernard. "Moishe Minkovski is performing at the Royal Albert Hall that night."

"So how about the following Monday?" asks Harry.

"No, I can’t do that night either," replies Bernard. "Moishe Minkovski is giving a Concert in Edinburgh."

"Well how about the Sunday after that?" asks Harry, hopefully.

"No, sorry," Bernard replies, "Moishe Minkovski is playing at the O2 centre."

"Oy, Bernard," says Harry, "you must be one of Moishe Minkovski’s greatest fans."

"You’re wrong there, Harry," says Bernard. "I’m definitely not a fan of his. In fact, I’ve never even seen him before."

"I don’t understand," says Harry.

"It’s not difficult to understand really," says Bernard. "Whenever Moishe Minkovski is at a concert, I go to see Rivkah."

"So who is Rivkah?" asks Harry.

"His wife," replies Bernard.

### #1770 The Hanukah present

[My thanks to Lisa S for the following]

Jeremy has been dating Hannah for only two weeks but in that time he’s fallen madly in love with her. And now he has a problem - it’s Chanukah tomorrow and he doesn’t know what to buy her. So he asks his big sister for some advice.

His sister tells him, "You’ve not been going out with her for very long, Jeremy, so I don’t think you should buy her anything too personal or too romantic. Be patient - these types of gift can come later. For now, I think something like a nice pair of pretty leather gloves might be appropriate. What do you think?"

"Great idea," Jeremy replies. "I’m leaving right now for the John Lewis Department Store and I’m going to choose a real pretty pair. I’m seeing Hannah today and I’ll give the present to her then."

Jeremy goes to John Lewis and after much discussion with the sales assistant, chooses a nice pair of pale grey gloves. He then goes to the payment desk, pays for the gloves and asks for them to be gift-wrapped. But by mistake, his package gets mixed up with the package belonging to the girl in front of him and without knowing, he ends up with some pink panties.

As soon as he gets home, Jeremy seals his package, writes a note, and drives to Hannah’s house. As soon as he gets there, he says to Hannah, "I’ve bought you this present for Chanukah, but before you open it, I’d like you to read my note. This is what Hannah read: -

### #1772 Trouble with the human race

Avrahom is having his first meeting with Mr Lewis, an eminent psychiatrist. "So, Avrahom," asks Mr Lewis, "why have you come to see me?"

"Because I am having trouble with the whole of the human race, doctor. They are stupid and they won’t listen to me."

"Can you give me some examples of how they …."

"They are calling me a crazy man," says Avrahom. "It doesn’t matter what I tell them, they call me meshugga. What do you do, doctor, when you meet stupid people who won’t listen to a word of truth?"

"OK, Avrahom, I’m getting to understand your problem. Why don’t you start from the beginning?"

"Oh thank you doctor," says Avrahom, "thank goodness someone wants to listen to me. In the beginning, I created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And my spirit moved upon the face ……."

### #1773 Torah honours

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Morry, the President of Edgware Amalgamated shul, is not as ‘orthodox’ as the shul’s committee would like him to be. But he knows a lot of influential people and gets things done. So they don’t complain too much about him.

This year, on the shabbes before Rosh Hashana, they decide to give him the honour of an aliyah and the shul’s gabbai goes over to him to tell him of the decision.

But Morry panics. "Oy vay, I just can’t do this," he says to the gabbai. "I can’t read Hebrew properly and I’ll embarrass everyone when I try to read the blessings. Please give the honour to someone else."

"But Morry," says the gabbai, "you must accept some kind of honour – after all, you are the shul’s President."

"I understand that," says Morry. "Is there some other kind of honour that doesn’t require me to speak Hebrew?"

"How about gelilah?" replies the gabbai.

"What is gelilah?" asks Morry, looking puzzled.

The gelilah gets involved just after the torah is lifted at hagbah," replies the gabbai. "As soon as the torah is lowered, the gelilah puts on the cover, breastplate and crown. The gelilah can then sit down - his job is over."

"Well that seems fine to me. I can handle that," says Morry. "It’s a deal. I accept."

Fifteen minutes later, it’s hagbah time and Morry is up there waiting for the torah to be lowered. He then puts on the cover, breastplate and crown as instructed and goes back to his seat feeling very pleased with himself. The gabbai immediately goes over to him and whispers, "Morry, I didn’t mean on YOU, I meant on the torah!"

### #1776  A choice of swimwear

Howard and his wife Becky are soon going on holiday and are doing some shopping for clothes. As they pass the ladies swimwear department, Becky says to Howard, "Darling, what do you think I should do? It’s been at least 10 years since I last bought any swimwear. I know I’ve put on some weight since then but I do need to buy something new for our holiday. So do you think I should go for a bikini or an all-in-one?"

"I think you should get a bikini," replies Howard, "because I don’t think you would get it all in one."

NOTE: Howard is hoping his black eye will heal before they go on holiday

### #1779 The power of a mezuzah

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Joshua operates a successful mobile phone business in Tel Aviv and has recently opened an office in Shanghai. When he rings Jian, his Chinese partner, to see how sales are doing in Shanghai, Jian says, "Mr Joshua, things are not going so well. Our shop is suffering from a number of robberies and I don’t know what to do. Do you have a similar problem in Tel Aviv?"

"No Jian, not really," replies Joshua. "We have this little box that we put on our doorframes, it’s called a mezuzah, and this protects our homes and offices from any harm."

"Oh then please send me one, Mr Joshua, as I don’t know what else to do."

Joshua puts one in the post that day with instructions on how to put it up. But three weeks later the mezuzah is returned to him, so Joshua rings Jian. "I’ve just got back the mezuzah I sent you. So nu, didn’t it work?"

"It worked fine, Mr Joshua," replies Jian, "I’ve had no more robberies."

"So why did you return it to me?" asks Joshua.

"Because it drove me and my customers mad, Mr Joshua, that’s why," replies Jian. "Almost as soon as I put it up, the shop kept on being visited by different types of men with collection boxes in their hands asking my customers, ‘tsedaka kallah?’"

### #1780 The business dinner

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

Joshua has been making his name as a designer of smart handbags, but even he is now finding times difficult, and his business is beginning to struggle. Then one day he gets some good news and immediately phones his wife Rebecca.

"Darling," he shouts down the phone, "I’ve done a brilliant deal. Mervyn Levy, the Handbag King no less, has just told me that he loves our handbags so much that he will buy every handbag we can make for him. I’ve invited him to have dinner with us tonight so that we can close the deal. What do you think about that?"

"Mazeltov, Joshua," replies Rebecca, "that’s fantastic news. But how can we have Mervyn here for dinner when we pawned our best dinner service last month? We don't have two matching plates to our name."

"Don’t worry," says Joshua, "I’m going to go to Abe the Pawnbroker right now. I know him well and he’ll let us have our dinner service back if I pay him immediately. Just give me the number of our ticket."

"It’s 946," replies Rebecca.

So Joshua goes to Abe’s shop and pays the bill for ticket 946. Abe gives him a receipt and goes into the storeroom to look for the item held against the ticket. He returns with a canteen of silver plated cutlery.

"Abe, this isn't my item," says Joshua. "There’s been a mistake."

Abe goes back into the storeroom and returns a few minutes later. "I’ve found out what the problem is, Joshua," he says. "Rebecca had ticket 964 not 946. I gave ticket 946 to Mervyn Levy."

"Oy Vay!" says Joshua, "and to think I was planning to get rich by relying on a knocker who has to pawn his property. And that shmuck thinks he’s coming to my house for dinner tonight."

### #1781 The three advisors

[My thanks to John T for the following]

As a result of global warming, a new flood is being predicted by all the world’s top scientists. They predict that it will be horrendous, wiping out maybe 70% of the world’s population. Not only that, but the Flood could be here in 3 to 4 days time. Oy vay iz meer!

Many famous people start to appear on television giving advice. One such program has the Pope, the Dalai Lama and the Chief Rabbi appearing together.

The Pope says, "It’s still not too late to accept Jesus as your Saviour."

The Dalai Lama says something similar, "I appeal to all of humanity to follow Buddhist teachings. If you do, you can find nirvana in the wake of the disaster."

But the Chief Rabbi has a totally different kind of message. He looks straight at the camera and says, "My people, we have just two or three days to learn how to live under water!"

### #1782 I’m not Jewish

[My thanks to Hanoch B for the following]

Moshe, a chassid, is talking to his friend Victor.  "As you know, Victor, my daughter Rifka is getting married soon and because you’re not only my friend, but have also been my study partner for nearly nine years, I would like to ask you to act as a witness under her chuppah. What do you say?"

"I'm sorry, Moshe," replies Victor looking sad, "I know it’s an honour but I can’t accept. I'm not Jewish."

"What do you mean you’re not Jewish?" says Moshe. "You've been coming to shakarit every morning for over ten years and you've been my chavruta for nearly as long. I don’t understand."

"Well," replies Victor, "It’s like this. I decided many years ago to convert to Judaism. Over the years that followed, I enjoyed not only the company but also the intellectual stimulation it provided. And I found respite in the shabbes. But somehow or other, Moshe, I just never completed the process I started. So I'm not Jewish. I’m so sorry."

"But hold on a minute, Victor," says Moshe. "Didn't we both learn in the gemara, only a few weeks ago, that if you're not Jewish, you can't keep the shabbes?"

"Yes, I remember. But don't worry, I always put my key in my pocket on Fridays so that I could carry it all shabbat."

"But our community has an eruv, Victor, you can carry a key without any problem."

"Yes, I know," responds Victor, "but I don't hold by it."

Kitty replies, "In the first place, Freda, I never borrowed any roasting tray from you. Secondly, it was only an old roasting tray anyway. And lastly, you must have noticed that when I returned it to you, it was in a better condition than when you lent it to me!"

[My thanks to John T for the following]

Naomi is about to leave her house to meet her three friends for their regular monthly get together. But as she bends down to pick up the last of the toys left on the floor by her four children, her back gives way. She’s in great pain, so she phones her friends and tells them that she won’t be able to go out with them that afternoon. Later that day, her three friends come to her house to commiserate.

"Oy Naomi," says Talia, "it’s such a shame you being laid up like this."

"Yes," says Fay, "it’s terrible. The pain you must be experiencing. Such tsouris you’ve got."

"I know what we can do," says Judith. "We’ll all pray for you every day until you get back on your feet."

As Talia and Fay are nodding their heads in agreement, Naomi says, "Better you three should come here every day and help out with the housework. Praying I can do by myself."

"Has she been sick?" asks doctor Myers.

"No, doctor," replies Bernie.

"Is she crying?" asks doctor Myers.

"No, doctor, she’s not crying," replies Bernie. "In fact she’s quite normal. But I’m still worried. All those aspirin. What should I be doing?"

"Well there is something you can do," replies doctor Myers. "You can try to give your Talya a headache."

### #1788 Mathematical correctness

Sharon is not the brightest secretary that Jonathan has employed, but she always does what she is asked to do. One day, Jonathan needs a long column of figures to be added up for a sales presentation he is giving later on that afternoon, so he says to Sharon, "please add up these figures for me and make sure you check the total is correct.

"Thank you, Sharon," says Jonathan, "and did you check it like I asked you to do?"

"Yes, sir, three times," replies Sharon, "and here are the three answers, sir."

### #1790 The yearly visit

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Sharon is out shopping one day in Hendon when she meets rabbi Levy.

"Hello rabbi," she says. "How are you? I hope you are keeping well."

"Well if I’m not mistaken," says rabbi Levy, "it’s Mrs Gross, isn’t it?"

"Yes rabbi, it is," replies Sharon.

"I haven’t seen you in shul now for quite some time," says rabbi Levy."

"I know," says Sharon, looking quite embarrassed, "I stopped going to shul some time ago because every time I went, it was always the same thing."

"Always the same thing?" asks rabbi Levy, looking puzzled, "I don’t understand you."

"Oh you must know, rabbi," explains Sharon, "KOL NIDRAY-AY VESORAY-AY."

### #1791 Are my sons OK?

Leah is an old fashioned type of mother. She has three teenage sons and she always wants re-assurances from them that they are going out with the ‘right kind’ of girl. Leah has read too many stories in the Jewish Chronicle newspaper of boys being led astray by the wrong kinds of girl.

Two of Leah’s sons are always telling her of the girls they meet, which satisfies her, but as for Benjy, her eldest, no such luck. He’s very cagey and secretive and tells her nothing – in fact he never mentions his girlfriends at all. Leah is sure something is not quite right, but she doesn’t know what.

This is aggravating her so much that one evening, as soon as Benjy goes out, she goes into his room and starts to look through his pockets. At last she finds something. It’s a silver and gold make-up case and on it is written: -

HELENA RUBINSTEIN

"Oy, thank God," she says aloud. "At least I now know that Benjy is going out with Jewish girls."

### #1792 Hannah’s tube ticket

[My thanks to both Frank R and Richard K for the following]

50 year old Hannah from Golders Green lives in a very friendly street. Everyone gets on well with each other even though they have mixed skin colours, religions and countries of origin. For example, Deepika, her next door neighbour, is one of Hannah’s best friends. She is a very generous lady and is always doing things for Hannah.

One Saturday morning, Deepika calls on Hannah and says, "I have to take a tube train to Victoria to meet my daughter. Can I get you anything while I’m out?"

"That’s really nice of you to ask," replies Hannah, "but I don’t need anything at present. And as you’re going by tube, why not take my season ticket and you won’t then have to pay for your travel. You can return my ticket when you get back."

Deepika takes Hannah’s ticket and thanks her.

30 minutes later, Deepika is on a tube train going to Victoria. But then a ticket inspector gets onto the train and when he reaches Deepika, he asks to see her ticket. She hands him Hannah’s ticket. He glances at the name on the ticket, takes a hard look at Deepika, and asks, "Excuse me lady, but are you Hannah Levy?"

Deepika smiles at the inspector and nods affirmatively.

Still suspicious, the inspector hands Deepika a blank piece of paper and says, "I need to compare signatures – could you please sign your name here."

"Man, are you really serious?" Deepika replies, very indignantly. "You’re asking me to write on our shabbes?"

### #1793 Golfing injury

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

It’s Sunday and Emma and Rose are in the middle of their regular round of golf. At the 13th hole, Rose tees off and watches in horror as her ball heads directly towards the two men playing the 14th hole. The ball hits Nathan, who immediately clasps both hands to his groin and falls to the ground rolling around in agony.

Rose rushes over to Nathan and says, "Look, I’m sorry about this, but I'm a chartered physiotherapist and I know how to relieve your pain. Do you want me to help you?"

"Oh there’s no need to do anything," Nathan says through clenched teeth. "I’ll be OK soon."

But after two minutes pass, Nathan is still obviously in pain. He’s lying on the grass in the foetal position and he’s still clasping his hands to his groin. So Rose once again asks whether she can help him. This time, Nathan replies, "Yes, oh yes. Please get rid of my pain."

So Rose gently goes over to him, bends down and gently takes his hands away from his groin. She then loosens his belt, undoes the top of his trousers, puts her hands inside, and administers special, tender and artful massage to his parts. After a while, Rose asks Nathan, "So how does that feel?"

"It feels absolutely wonderful," replies Nathan, "but I still think my thumb is broken."

### #1795 The hotel sign

When Isaac goes to New York on business, he always stays at the Hilton. But this time, just for a change, he decides to book in at the Broyges Hotel. He chooses this hotel because the big neon sign out front says: -

BROYGES HOTEL. SALT BEEF & LATKES. TV

Isaac goes into reception, pays the manager in advance for a deluxe room, gets the porter to take his bag to his room, and goes to get a bite to eat in the dining room. He orders the salt beef and is disappointed when, 15 minutes later, a rather tired looking salt beef sandwich and latke arrive. As soon as he finishes eating, he goes to his room where he is hoping to see a good football game on the TV. But when he gets there, he’s dismayed to see that there is no TV in his room. He goes immediately to the Manager to complain.

"Excuse me mister manager," says Isaac, "there is no TV in my room."

"Did anyone say there should be?" asks the manager.

"Yes," replies Isaac, "it states TV clearly on your hotel sign."

"I think you’ve got this wrong," says the manager, "TV means TOURISTS VELCOME."

### #1796 The back seat champion

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Sarah couldn't ride in a car without telling whoever is driving what to do, when to do it, etc. She was, bar none, the worst back seat driver in the world. Her husband Hayim long thought this, though she would deny it. She claimed she seldom, if ever, made comments about his driving and he, of course, claimed the opposite. And suddenly, there was proof.

The other day, Hayim was driving Sarah and their daughter to the shopping centre when little Shuli piped up, "Daddy, before you married Mummy, who told you how to drive?"

### #1798 A rate check

Ruth looks up the yellow pages, finds what she’s looking for and makes a phone call. "Hello," says Ruth, "am I talking to the loony doctor?"

"If you are referring to a psychiatrist, then yes, you are talking to one. I am Mr Martin Lewis, a qualified psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist and cranial surgeon. How can I help you?"

"I’m farfufket," replies Ruth, "I have awful thoughts 24 hours a day and I’m doing things that I can’t even remember doing. I think I’m going meshugga."

"I can help you," says Mr Lewis.

"As it might take some time to cure me," continues Ruth, "I need to know how much you charge and whether you can offer me a discount."

"I charge a flat fee of £250 per visit, and I don’t offer discounts," replies Mr Lewis. "Everyone pays me the same."

"What? £250 per visit?" shrieks Ruth, "Do you think I’m a meshuggeneh?" and slams down the phone.

### #1799 The big shot

Louis from Texas is visiting his friend David in London. Louis is a bit of a groisser sheeser, and during his stay, says to David, "I bet you didn’t know that I have 400 cows back home?"

"Surely," says David, "most Texans have that number of cattle?"

"You’re right there, David," replies Louis, "but how many have 400 in their freezer?"

### #1800 Her prayer is answered …. sort of

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

One shabbes, Rabbi Bloom finishes his sermon by asking his congregation whether anyone would like to express thanks to God for a recent event. Leah immediately stands up and announces, "I would like you all to know that I feel immense gratitude for the way Hashem recently answered my prayers."

"OK Leah," says Rabbi Bloom, "please do tell us about it."

"Some of you might have noticed that my husband Benny and I have not been coming to shul recently. Two months ago, Benny had a terrible accident. A car ran straight into him as he was crossing the road and his scrotum was completely crushed. For days and days, the pain he was experiencing was so terrible that he sometimes cried out for help. But his doctors didn't at first know how to help him."

There were gasps from the men in the shul as they thought of Benny’s pain.

"Benny couldn’t even hold our children," continues Leah, "because every move he made caused him yet more pain. But then, out of the blue, doctor Minky decided to try out a new type of operation on Benny that had been pioneered in Israel. That was when I prayed to God to help the operation to succeed. I prayed the night before the operation and I prayed the next morning as doctor Minky performed his delicate operation on Benny. Fortunately, he managed to join together the crushed pieces of Benny’s scrotum and then wrap a thin plastic sheet around them to hold everything in place."

Again, there were gasps from the men in the shul as they visualised what Benny must have gone through.

"Benny is now out of hospital," continues Leah, "and his prognosis is good. Doctor Minky says that over the next 12 months, Benny’s scrotum should recover completely."

All the men in the shul sigh with relief. Rabbi Bloom then thanks Leah for her uplifting story and asks his congregation whether anyone wants to comment on what they have just heard. A man rises from his seat and introduces himself. "For those who don’t know me, I'm doctor Minky."

After the clapping dies down, doctor Minky says, "And I would like to tell Leah and all of you here today that the word is ‘sternum’ not ‘scrotum.’"

"So when was it signed?" asks Abe, one of the party.

The guide replies, "1215."

"OK," replies Gary, "why not? I’ll get one for you on Saturday."

Gary keeps to his promise and buys Ollie his very own television on Saturday morning. That afternoon, after watching his television for hours, Ollie finally comes downstairs. "Dad," he asks, "what is love juice?"

"Oy vay," thinks Gary, "it didn’t take him long to find the sex channels." So he decides that now was the time to tell Ollie about sex.  After Ollie’s five-minute introduction to sex and babies is over, Gary says to Ollie, "So Ollie, tell me, what programme were you watching before?"

"Wimbledon Tennis," replies Ollie.

So I’ve decided I must get fitter and lose some weight and I’m going to start first thing tomorrow. But in the meantime, darling, could you please boost my confidence by paying me a compliment."

"I haven’t seen you in shul for some time," says Rabbi Landau.

"Yes, you're right rabbi," says Rachel, "I stopped going because every time it's always the same thing."

"Why do you need to do that, dear?" Benny asks.

"Because," replies Rachel, "he has just phoned to tell us that we are overdrawn by that amount."

### #1810 It won’t be a problem

Because their lovely son David doesn’t seem to be able to find a wife, his parents invite a shadchen to their home to see what can be done. After listening to them for 30 minutes, the shadchen turns to David and, with an apprehensive voice, says, "I may have someone for you, but ….. she’s a bit short sighted."

"Her eyesight won’t be a problem to me," says David.

Feeling a bit more optimistic, the shadchen continues, "And she limps, but it’s not too bad because she’s left handed and she only limps on her right foot."

"Her walking abilities won’t matter much to me either," says David.

"And she’s also just a teeny weeny bit deaf," continues the shadchen.

"Well," says David, shrugging his shoulders, "so what if she doesn’t hear too well? It won’t make any difference to me."

At that, David’s father can’t hold in his rage any longer. "What’s wrong with you David? Does nothing matter to you? Don’t you worry about her disabilities?"

"No dad," replies David, "they don’t worry me because whoever’s taking her should worry about them, not me."

### #1811 For the eyes of Bridge experts only

Daisy, an au-pair, is looking for a new family to work for, so when her friend shows her an advert in the Jewish Chronicle for someone to look after a family of four, she immediately applies for the position. During her interview, Rachel, the lady of the house asks her, "So Daisy, tell me, why did you leave your last position?"

"Well, madam," replies Daisy, "I can’t complain about the money, I got a fair wage. I left because there were weird things going on there."

"What do you mean by that, Daisy?" asks Rachel.

"Well madam," replies Daisy, "one night a lot of folk were at the house to play a game called Bridge. They asked me to help out serving the drinks. Just as I was about to enter the lounge with my tray, I heard a man say, ‘lay down and let me see what you’ve got.’  So I didn’t enter. How could I?

Then I heard another man say, ‘I’ve got strength but no length.’  And then, when I heard a third man say to a lady, ‘take your hand off my trick,’ I was shocked to hear the lady reply, ‘you forced me, you jumped me twice when you didn’t have the strength for one raise.’

Then I heard one lady talking about protecting her honour, and soon after that I heard another lady say, ‘Now it’s time for me to play with your husband and you can play with mine.’

Finally, when I heard one of the men say, ‘I think we’ll go home now, this is my last rubber,’ I decided then and there to leave. So I put on my hat and coat and walked out, never to return."

"Yes, I have them in front of me," replies the bank manager.

"So could you tell me what was my account balance at the end of each of the last 3 months," asks Moshe.

"Yes, of course," replies the bank manager. "Over the last three months, your account ended the month in credit by £789.26, £1,245.90 and £444.01."

"So nu, mister bank manager," says Moshe, "did I phone you up on those occasions?”

### #1814 Beginnings of mankind

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

One day, eight-year-old Melissa says to her mother, "Mummy, I’ve been thinking about us humans and I’m a bit puzzled. How did we humans first appear on Earth?"

"That’s a very good question, darling," her mother replies. "God made Adam and Eve and they had children and then their children had children, and as a result, mankind began."

Later that day, Melissa asks her father the same question. "Daddy, how did we humans first appear on earth?"

"That’s an intelligent question, Melissa," he replies. "Millions of years ago there were monkeys from which, gradually, the human race evolved."

Melissa is confused by this answer and goes back to her mother. "Mummy," she asks, "how come that you told me the human race was created by God, yet daddy said they developed from monkeys?"

"Well darling, replies her mother, smiling, "the answer is simple. I told you about my side of the family and your father told you about his."

### #1817 How to get on in business

[My thanks to Anna R for the following]

Although Joshua is a bright young man, he didn’t do too well at his school exams and as a result, his first job is working for a successful Film Studio as a mailroom delivery boy. One morning, he’s delivering some mail to Mr Gold, the Company’s Chairman and Managing Director. Joshua knocks on Mr Gold’s door and enters. There, standing by the window, is Mr Gold and he’s waving to someone in the street. Mr Gold turn’s round, sees Joshua and calls him over to join him at the window.

"Joshua, do you see those two women down there by the Lamborghini?" asks Mr Gold.

"Yes sir, I do," replies Joshua.

"Well, Joshua," says Mr Gold, kvelling, "one of those ladies is my wife Rebecca and the other woman is Penelope Cruz."

"Is that so, sir," says Joshua, "so which one of them is Penelope Cruz?"

At that, Mr Gold walks to his desk, sits down, opens a drawer, takes out a cheque book and then asks Joshua, "What’s your surname?"

"Levine, sir," replies Joshua.

Mr Gold then writes out a cheque made payable to Joshua Levine for the sum of £1,000 and hands it over to Joshua.

Joshua is shocked to see the sum involved and says, "Thank you very much Mr Gold, but what’s it for? I haven’t done anything to deserve it."

"I’ve given you this cheque, Joshua," replies Mr Gold, "because in a few year’s time, I will have retired, you will own this company, and it will be your Lamborghini outside. So I want to be able to say that I gave you your first thousand pounds."

Rabbi Bloom meets the latest members to join his shul - Harry and Kitty Feltz. He shakes their hands in a very friendly and warm manner, then asks, "So Kitty, how many children do you have?"

"Sadly, rabbi," replies Kitty, "we are not yet blessed with any children."

"I’m sorry to hear this," says Rabbi Bloom. "God works in many mysterious ways so let me help you. Let me write down your names on this piece of paper and I’ll get it placed in the Kotel for a special blessing."

"Thank you very much, rabbi," they say.

Not too many years later, Rabbi Bloom meets Kitty in the street and remembering their last meeting asks her, "So how is your family, Kitty? How many children do you have?"

"Well rabbi, your prayers for us were answered. We are now blessed with 11 children. We have one pair of twins and three sets of triplets."

"Mazeltov Kitty," says Rabbi Bloom. "I’m very pleased to hear that things have worked out so well for you. I would also like to wish your husband mazeltov, but I don’t see him here. Where is he?"

"He’s currently in Jerusalem, rabbi," replies Kitty.

"Oy, how nice," says Rabbi Bloom. "So tell me, what’s he doing there? Is he on business?"

"No, he’s not there on business, rabbi. He’s there trying to find that note you had placed in the wall five years ago," Kitty replies.

8 year old Sam is staying with his bubbeh Rachel for a few days whilst his parents are away on business. On the first afternoon, she drives to school to pick up Sam and waits for him to come out. When Sam appears, he walks over to her and says, "Bubbeh, I was talking to my friend Jake at school today and we would like to know what you call two people who sleep in the same bedroom, with one on top of the other?"

Rachel is surprised by this question, but as she’s always been one to answer all questions honestly, she replies, "Well bubbeleh, it’s called sexual intercourse. It’s how parents make little children."

"Thanks bubbeh," says Sam, I’m just going to tell Jake.

She watches him wander over and talk to another boy. Sam then returns and they drive back to her place.

When she picks up Sam from school the next day, he says to her, "Bubbeh, you were wrong yesterday. It isn't called sexual intercourse, it’s called bunk beds. And Jake’s mum says she wants to talk to you."

Kitty has just turned 40 and is very worried about her health. So she decides to see her gynaecologist, Dr Myers. When she enters his office, he says to her, "And what brings you here today to see me, Kitty?"

Kitty just blushes and is unable to say anything.

"Why are you so embarrassed, Kitty?" asks Dr Myers. "You’ve been seeing me for years and you’ve always been able to discuss your problems with me."

"I know," replies Kitty, "but this problem is a little bit different, doctor."

"Maybe," says Dr Myers, "but why don’t you let me be the judge of that?"

"Well, OK," says Kitty, "it’s like this. When I went to the toilet yesterday morning, as soon as I sat down I heard a plink plink noise. I looked down and there in the water were some 5p coins. I immediately got up and left. When I went to the toilet again some hours later, I again heard a plink plink noise and when I looked down, there were some 10p coins in the water. And then, this morning, the same thing, only this time there were some 20p coins in the water. Oh doctor, what’s happening to me? Have I got a serious illness? I’m so worried."

Dr Myers smiles at her and says, "Dear Kitty, you’re not dying, take my word for it. There’s nothing the matter with you. You're simply going through the change."

Just then, the briefcase bursts open and spills its contents onto the floor. The man stares at Rabbi Levy with fear in his eyes and replies, "How on earth did you do that?"

### #1828 Daniel’s donkey

Daniel, a scrap metal merchant and one of the few in the business still to use a donkey to pull his trailer, has been married to Judith for over 30 years. In all those years, Daniel can safely say that there’s never been a day when she hasn't nagged him. She is always complaining about something or another and the only time Daniel gets any relief is when he’s out with his donkey buying and selling scrap metal. So naturally, he goes out as often as he can.

One day, Daniel is in his back yard sitting on an upturned bucket next to his donkey. Judith brings him his lunch as usual and as soon as he has said his brochehs, Judith begins her nagging. Oy, and does she nag and kvetch! It just goes on and on with no respite.  But then disaster. Daniel’s trusty donkey, for no reason at all, suddenly kicks out with both his back legs and catches Judith with a zetz to her head killing her instantly.

At the levoyah the next day, the Rabbi notices something strange. When women mourners go over to Daniel and whisper something in his ear, Daniel nods his head in agreement.  But when male mourners go over to Daniel and whisper something in his ear, he shakes his head in disagreement.

After the levoyah, the Rabbi asks Daniel why he nodded his head and agreed with all the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men.

"Well Rabbi," replies Daniel, "the women were telling me what a tzaddekes my wife was, how generous she was and how she was such a good mother. So I nodded my head in agreement, Rabbi."

"But what about the men?" the Rabbi asks, "Why were you disagreeing with them? What were they saying to you?"

"They wanted to know if I was willing to sell my donkey to them."

### #1829 How to choose a car

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

It’s Hetty’s birthday and her husband Howard tells her that he has decided to buy her a new car. Hetty is thrilled and can’t thank Howard enough. Later that morning they go car hunting.

After visiting half a dozen car dealers, Hetty finds a car she likes the look of. Howard calls over the salesman to prepare papers for his signing whilst Hetty goes back to the car to look at it one more time. Suddenly she sees something she doesn’t like. She goes back to Howard and says, "I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want it."

"But why, darling?" asks Howard, looking quite sad. "You loved it 5 minutes ago."

"I don’t want to talk about it," says Hetty. "Just take me home."

Later, she tells Howard what caused her to change her mind. "I suddenly realised that it was an ‘extra luxury’ model and so it had XL on its boot lid. I just couldn’t own a car with XL on it. It’s bad enough having XL on my underwear."

### #1830 Baby’s first check up

[My thanks to Suzy R for the following]

Doctor Kosiner has just joined a new doctors’ practice and today is his first session on duty. The first patient to enter his office is a woman holding a baby. "How can I help you?" he says to the woman.

"Today, doctor, is the date booked for baby Sam’s first check-up," she replies.

"OK," says doctor Kosiner, "Let’s take a good look at him."

He then examines baby Sam from top to bottom and finishes his examination by weighing the baby. He hands back baby Sam with a worried look on his face and says, "Is the baby bottle fed or breast fed?"

"He’s breast fed, doctor," she replies.

"OK then," he says to her, "could you please strip down to the waist. I need to check something out."

She does as she’s told. Doctor Kosiner then looks at her right nipple, pinches it and gently rubs it. He then looks at her left nipple, pinches it and rubs it gently. He then rubs both breasts for a while in a very professional way. When he finishes examining her, doctor Kosiner says, "Baby Sam is underweight and I’ve found out why. You don’t have any breast milk."

"That doesn’t surprise me at all," she says.

"Why do you say that?" asks doctor Kosiner, looking a bit puzzled.

"Because I’m baby Sam’s bubbeh, that’s why," she replies. "But don’t worry, doctor, I’m very glad I came because mine Arnold doesn’t do such nice things to me these days."

### #1831 Why aren’t you married already?

Issy arrives home from work one evening and noticing that his daughter Sharon is nowhere to be seen says to his wife Rebecca, "Nu? So where’s Sharon?"

"She’s in her bedroom," replies Rebecca, abruptly. "We had another argument."

Issy goes upstairs to see whether he can sort things out. "What’s the matter, Sharon?" he asks.

"It’s mummy, dad," replies Sharon. "She keeps on and on at me for not being married already. All she does is kvetch and krechtz. It’s driving me crazy. I just won’t rush into marriage until I find someone really special. Please talk to her, dad."

"I’ll do my best," replies Issy. "I’ll mention our little conversation to mummy as soon as the right moment comes along."

"Thanks dad," says Sharon.

That night, when they’re in bed, Rebecca says to Issy, "So what did our alteh moid daughter have to say to you earlier?"

"She said you’re always on her back about her not being married," Issy replies. "I think you should leave her alone. She’s still only 21 and she’s waiting until the right man comes along."

"Why should she have to wait for the right man?" says Rebecca. "I didn’t when I got married."

### #1832 What are best friends for?

Victor, an up-and-coming accountant, is called into his manager’s office. "Victor," says his manager, "we’re having some problems in our New York office and you’ll be pleased to hear that we think you’re the best man to sort them out. We want you to drop everything you’re doing and be in New York in the next few days."

When he gets back to his desk, Victor phones his best friend. "Daniel," he says, "they’re sending me to New York for a week and I don’t think Judith is going to like it. We’ve been married now for nearly eight years and in all that time we’ve never been apart for more than a few hours. She hasn’t even got children to keep her company. So I’m hoping you can do me a favour."

"Of course," replies Daniel. "What would you like me to do?"

"It’s quite easy," says Victor. "I’m going to give you £200. Please use it to take out Judith as often as you can. She knows you’re my friend and she’ll be pleased to have some company whilst I’m away."

"Of course, no problem," says Daniel.

As soon as Victor returns from his week in New York, he immediately phones Daniel. "So Daniel, how did it go? Did you manage to persuade Judith to go out with you?"

There was a brief silence before Daniel replies. "Look Victor, I must be honest with you. But you won’t like what I’m going to say."

"So tell me already," says Victor.

"Well, it was like this," replies Daniel. "I went round to your house on the first night you were away. I told Judith that you had asked me to take her out and that you had also given us £200 to spend. She was a bit embarrassed at first but she soon agreed. So I took her to see the show, ‘The Sound of Music,’ followed afterwards by a bite to eat. I then drove her home, said goodnight, and was just about to go to my car when she invited me in for a drink. She showed me around your house and we ended up in the bedroom where we sat at the end of the bed talking about our lives. One thing seemed to lead to another and soon, without even thinking about it, we both got undressed and made love. But the one consoling thing is that we immediately realised that what we had done was wrong and how hurt you would be when you learned what had happened between your wife and your best friend. And Oy Victor, how we then cried. We literally cried our eyes out. And Victor, I’m pleased to tell you that it was like that for the rest of the week - sex and crying, sex and crying, sex and crying."

### #1833 The Ostrich

Moshe walks into Minky’s Restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him. When the waitress asks him for his order, Moshe says, "Salt Beef and latkes plus a coke please." She then turns to the ostrich, "What's yours?"

"I'll have the same," says the ostrich.

Five minutes later the waitress returns with the order. "That will be £19.46 please," she says. Moshe reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, Moshe and the ostrich return. Moshe orders, "Salt Beef and latkes plus a coke please."

The ostrich says, "I'll have the same."

Again Moshe reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change.

This becomes routine for six consecutive days until the two enter again. "The usual?" asks the waitress.

"No, this is Thursday night, so I’ll have a sirloin steak, baked potato and a salad," says Moshe.

"Same," says the ostrich.

Soon after, the waitress brings the order and says, "That will be £26.62."

Once again Moshe pulls the exact change from his pocket and puts it on the table.

The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. "How do you manage to come up with the exact change in your pocket every time?" she asks.

"Well," says Moshe, "several years ago, I was cleaning out my loft and found an old lamp in the corner. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there."

"That's brilliant," says the waitress. "Most people would ask for a million pounds or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!"

"That's right," says Moshe. "Whether it's a pint of milk or a Lexus, the exact money is always there."

The waitress then asks, "So what's with the ostrich, then?"

Moshe sighs, pauses and answers, "My second wish was for a tall bird with a big toches and long legs who agrees with everything I say."

### #1834 The patient’s revenge

For the last three months, Hymie has been going through one medical problem after another and has spent most of this period in bed. First he had a minor heart attack, then he developed pneumonia, and then he fell badly and slipped a disc in his back. Now, at last, he seems to be getting over his troubles and today he’s going to see doctor Myers, his specialist, for a check-up. But he’s definitely not looking forward to this because doctor Myers has regularly given him negative prognoses.

45 minutes later, after giving Hymie a thorough going over, doctor Myers says, "Well, Hymie, you’ll be pleased to learn that I’m very satisfied with your progress."

Hymie can’t believe the optimism doctor Myers is now showing after all the previous doom and gloom. "Well, thank goodness for that," says Hymie, "it’s about time I heard some good news from you."

"Your heart rhythm is strong," says doctor Myers, "your lungs are clear, you’ve got a nice skin colour and you’re looking very healthy indeed. You’ve still got a slipped disk, however, but I’m not really worried about it."

"Listen doctor," says Hymie, "if you had a slipped disk, believe me, I wouldn’t be worried about it either."

### #1835 He’s got it coming

[My thanks to Stan C for the following]

Miriam decides to seek the help of a psychic counsellor. She looks through the yellow pages and selects MISS BASHAYRT, primarily because her advert seems to indicate that she has had a lot of success in Tarot Reading. Miriam makes an appointment to see her.

Later that week, she’s with the psychic in a dark and gloomy room with just a flickering candle to provide some light. For the last ten minutes Miss Bashayrt has been silently gazing down at the Tarot cards laid out on the table in front of her. Then suddenly she speaks.

"There is no easy way for me to tell you this, so I’m going to be quite blunt with you."

"OK," says Miriam, "I’m ready for the bad news. Fire away."

"You must prepare yourself to be a widow," continues Miss Bashayrt. "The cards clearly show that very soon your husband is going to die a grisly death."

Even though Miriam thought she was ready, she is still visibly shaken. She stares at the cards, then at the candle, takes two deep breaths and feeling more composed, looks Miss Bashayrt in the eye and calmly asks, "Nu? So will I get away with it?"

### #1836 The Emporium

Bernie is walking down Edgware High Street when he notices the following sign in the shop window of ‘Moshe’s Kosher Emporium’

ALL THE DEVCIES YOU NEED FOR YOUR HOEM

So he goes inside and asks to see Moshe.

"Can I help you, sir?" Moshe asks Bernie.

"I just wanted to point out that you have two spelling errors in the sign you have in your window."

"Yes, I know," says Moshe. "It’s a deliberate marketing policy. You see, we get around a dozen people coming in here each day to point this out to us, and of these, at least 3 or 4 buy something.  And now that you’re in here, sir, can I interest you in our special low price for a kitchen table and four chairs?"

### #1838 What a surprise!

[My thanks to Sylvia S for the following]

Shmuel has been living by himself for many years, but when he reaches 30 he decides that he has had enough already of feeling lonely. So he goes to see a local shadchen.

"I’m looking for a nice wife," Shmuel says.

"OK, you’ve come to the right place," says the shadchen. "So what kind of ‘nice wife’ would suit you best?"

"Well," replies Shmuel, "she doesn’t have to be rich, she doesn’t even need to be beautiful or have a great figure. What I’m looking for is a lebediker fisch."

A few days later, the shadchen contacts Shmuel. "I’ve found someone for you."

Two months later, Shmuel and Naomi get married. But when, five months later, Naomi gives birth to a lovely bouncing boy, Shmuel immediately contacts the shadchen. "I have a complaint to make about your selection process," Shmuel says. "I asked for a leberdiker fisch, not a gefilte fish!"

### #1840 Happiness is …….

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

As they do every Wednesday, 80 year old Rebecca meets up with 82 year old Fay in Brent Cross Shopping Centre.

"So nu?" says Rebecca, "what’s news, Fay? You’ve got a lovely smile on your face."

"I finally got a letter from mine son Max in Israel," replies Fay. "It’s the first letter I’ve got from him in over 3 months."

"And what good news does this son of yours give you? asks Rebecca.

"He says his wife was knocked down by a car 7 weeks ago," replies Fay, "and that he’s had to leave his job as a financial advisor to look after his wife and their two little girls. As a consequence, his salary, private medical policy and health insurance will end in a few weeks time."

"Oy," says Rebecca.

"And that’s not all," continues Fay. "With the property market the way it is, Rebecca, he’s also finding it impossible to sell his house to get some capital to live on. And to cap it all, his lovely baby girl has been diagnosed with leukaemia and she needs some expensive treatment to pull through. Max is so worried, Rebecca. He just doesn't know what to do for the best."

"Oy vay," cries Rebecca, "what a terrible story you’ve just told me, Fay. So why are you looking so happy?"

"Because mine son writes to his little old mother such beautifully constructed letters written in Hebrew. They’re a pleasure to read," replies Fay.

### #1842 How to handle a sports mad husband

[My thanks to Suzy R for the following]

Judith meets her friend Leah at Brent Cross Shopping Centre and notices that Leah is looking very sad. "So what’s wrong, Leah?" she asks.

"My Bernie is besotted with sport," replies Leah. "He’s always watching sport on TV, going to sport, or participating in sport. He just doesn’t seem to know I exist these days and I don’t know what to do about it."

"This happened to me some years ago, Leah," says Judith, "and I did something about it that worked straight away."

"So tell me already," begs Leah.

"I went shopping and bought one of the most sexy and daring negligees I could find. Then when my Max came home from work, and before he could turn on the TV, I came right up to him in my negligee, posed provocatively, draped my arms and legs all over him then offered him anything he wanted, and I mean anything, Leah. Our relationship changed instantly from that moment on. Why don’t you try it? It can’t hurt."

Leah thinks for a few seconds, then says, "I’ve got to go now, Judith. I’ve something important I need to buy. See you soon."

That afternoon, when Bernie arrives home from work, there’s Leah in her short, see-through negligee to meet him at the door. She smells of Christian Dior’s ‘Miss Dior’, his favourite perfume. She takes his hand, leads him up to the bedroom, and whispers sexily in his ear, "Why don’t you tie me up, lover boy, and I’ll let you do a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g you want?"

Bernie smiles with delight, ties her up to the bedpost, then goes out for a round of golf.

### #1845 Early warning

As soon as Morris arrives home from work, he says to his wife Judith, "Darling, I’ve invited Paul, one of my workmates, to have dinner with us here tonight. He should be here in about 30 minutes."

"Are you meshuggah, Morris?" shouts Judith. "I haven’t done any housekeeping today and the house is in a terrible mess. Nor have I had time to wash the dishes from this morning. Not only that but we’ve no food in the fridge and as I didn’t feel like going shopping today, I was planning for us to eat out tonight."

"But that’s how it always is," says Morris.

"If you knew that, Morris," says Judith, "then why on earth did you invite Paul round for dinner?"

"Because the shmuck is thinking about getting married," replies Morris.

### #1846 The website error

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Jakob the Yekke lives in Tel Aviv and is planning to visit his parents in Jerusalem in a week’s time. As he wants to go by train, he looks up the possible seating options on the Israel Railways website and decides exactly where he will to sit. Jakob then goes into his local travel agent and tells the clerk, "I want a return ticket to Jerusalem for next Sunday please. I must have a seat facing forward so I would like to book seat 34A in carriage number 5 for both journeys."

The booking clerk gives him the tickets he’s specifically requested.

One week later, Jakob arrives at Tel Aviv station 45 minutes before the departure time, walks down the platform, gets into carriage number 5 and finds seat 34A. But to his horror, this seat is a backward facing seat. The Israel Railways website he had accessed a week ago was obviously wrong. There was nothing he could do except sit in seat 34A and complain to Israel Railways later.

As soon as he arrives in Jerusalem, Jakob calls Israel Railways, points out the error on their website, and tells them how frightening the journey was for him travelling backwards.

After apologizing profusely to him, the Israel Railways representative asks him, "But in view of your fear of travelling backwards, why didn't you ask the person sitting opposite you whether it was possible for you to switch seats?"

"I would have gladly done so," replies Jakob, "but I couldn’t because that seat was empty."

### #1847 The amended passport

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Hannah’s marriage to Barry was not working out and after 5 years of hell living with a bulvon, she gets divorced. As Hannah wants nothing further to do with Barry, she decides to have her maiden name re-instated on all her legal documents. Today, she goes to the Passport Office to have her passport amended.

"Can I help you?" asks the lady clerk behind the counter.

"Oh yes please," replies Hannah, "I need to have my maiden name re-instated on my passport. I’ve bought it with me."

The clerk looks up at Hannah and asks, "Do you also want to have your address changed?"

"No," replies Hannah, "that won’t be necessary."

"Oh mazeltov, I’m pleased for you," says the clerk. "I see you also got to keep the house."

### #1848 The unusual job interview

Howard, a media marketing manager, has recently been made redundant by the Jewish Chronicle. Although he’s strictly orthodox, he’s doing something today he never thought would happen – he’s going to a job interview with Mr Smith of the New Methodist Times newspaper.  The job advertised is very similar to the one he was doing previously and the interview therefore goes well. Then Mr Smith asks, "So, Howard, what kind of salary are you looking for?"

Howard has a wife and four children, they live in a prosperous area of town, and two of his children go to Private School. So he has prepared for such a question. He replies, "Because of my skills, experience and the job match, I think £80,000 per annum is the right salary for the job. This is no more than I was receiving at the JC."

"Unfortunately," says Mr Smith, "although you have the right skills and experience for the job, you don’t know much about us Protestants. I think you need to initially accept £60,000 per annum for the job and when you have learned more about the way we tick, we can consider moving you up to the £80,000 you require."

"I’m not at all happy with your offer," says Howard. "I have a lot of expenses to cover. Even though I’m orthodox, as I told you, and even though I keep a kosher home, I still have to bring home the bacon!"

### #1849 The Will reading

Morris dies suddenly soon after his 70th birthday. Two month’s later, his family is sitting around the desk of Morris’s solicitor for the reading of the Will.  The solicitor thanks all of them for coming and then reads out Morris’s Last Will and Testament.

"I, Morris Avrahom Levy, being of sound mind, make the following gifts. To my beautiful, sweet wife Rivkah, I leave my Hampstead house, my Birchington holiday flat, and £800,000 in cash and shares.  Enjoy darling. To my handsome and hardworking son Paul, I leave my Lexus car and £200,000 in cash. Keep up the good work, Paul.  To my gorgeous and clever daughter Suzanne, I leave my Jaguar car and £200,000 in cash. I love you, darling Suzy. And to my brother Henry, who always told me in no uncertain terms that ‘health’ is so much more important than ‘wealth’, I leave my exercise bike and treadmill."

### #1850 The walk past

[My thanks to Rachel Saunders for the following]

It’s a hot summer’s day and Rabbi Landau is walking with his pupils on Minnis Bay beach when a beautiful young girl in a swimming suit walks towards them. Rabbi Landau immediately says to them, "Don’t look, boys, turn away your eyes."  Over the next 10 minutes, many young girls in their swimsuits walk past them and each time Rabbi Landau says to his pupils, "don’t look, don’t look. Avert your eyes."

But then a gorgeous girl comes into sight wearing the skimpiest of bikinis. She also has a voluptuous figure. Rabbi Landau just can’t take his eyes off her as she walks towards them.

The pupils are very confused with the rabbi’s behaviour, so they go to him and ask, "Rabbi, you told us earlier not to look at the girls in their swimming suits, but just now, as soon as the girl in the bikini came into sight, you looked at her and haven’t stopped looking at her. You haven’t even told us not to look at her. Why is this rabbi? We’re confused. Is it right or is it wrong to look at girls?"

"It depends on the girl, my boys," replies Rabbi Landau, smiling. "That girl is 100% kosher because the milchedik (he points to her bikini top) is very clearly separate from the flayshedik (he points to her bikini bottom.)"

### #1851 The motor mechanic

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

It’s morning in Tel Aviv and inside THE KOSHER MOTOR garage, Jeremy Landau, one of the City’s brightest mechanics, has started to repair the engine of an old Ford. As he removes the Ford’s cylinder head, he notices Dr David Freud, a respected cardiologist, arriving to pick up his Mercedes which Jeremy has just finished servicing.

Jeremy calls over to Dr Freud, "Could you come over here please doctor, I’d like to show you something."

Dr Freud walks over. "So nu, Jeremy," he says, "what’s this thing that’s so important?"

Pointing to the Ford and with a mischievous smile on his face, Jeremy replies, "I have a question for you. Just look at this engine, doctor. I’ve just opened up its heart. I will then carefully remove its valves and when I’ve done this, I will look for any existing damage. When I find it, which I always do, I will carefully repair it and put everything back together again and it will then work like new. So, doctor, my question to you is this: even though you and I are basically doing the same kind of work, how come I’m on a salary of just under 160,000 shekels a year whereas you probably take home around 1 million shekels a year?"

Dr Freud thinks about this for a few seconds, then smiles and replies, "The difference is, Jeremy  …. try doing your work with the engine running."

### #1853 First week at school

It’s Friday afternoon and Miriam picks up her 5 year old daughter Esther at the end of her first week at primary school. When they get home, Miriam asks Esther, "Well, bubbeleh darling, how was your first week at your lovely new school? Was it as nice as mummy told you it would be?"

"No, mummy," replies little Esther, looking very serious, "no it was not!"

"Oh my poor wonderful darling," says Miriam sadly, "why didn’t you enjoy yourself?"

Little Esther replies, "Well mummy, I think I'm just wasting my time going to school."

"Why is this, my beautiful princess?" asks Miriam.

"Because, mummy," replies little Esther, "I can't write properly, I can't read properly, and my teacher won't let me talk."

### #1854 The Queen’s English

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

There are strong rumours circulating around Buckingham Palace that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is working on plans to have Queen Elizabeth II and the rest of the Royal Family taxed on exactly the same terms as if they were private individuals. Naturally, when the Queen gets to hear of these rumours, she is definitely not amused and immediately begins to look for a suitably experienced tax advisor to stop this nonsense. All the Palace officials tell her that she must get hold of a financial advisor called Hetty Abrams. They also inform her that Hetty is in her 60s, has an excellent reputation for her tax knowledge, but is very direct, often appearing rude.

Within days, Hetty Abrams is visited by Carruthers of MI5 and asked discreetly whether she would be willing to help the Queen. Hetty agrees, but only on condition that she is first of all given access to the last 5 years worth of income and expenditure relating to the Queen’s ‘business,’ and then that Prince Philip should attend her meeting with the Queen. All is agreed.

Within days, Hetty is working at Buckingham Palace, pouring over the Queen's complicated financial data. There’s a lot of information to go through and this takes many days to digest, but finally, five days after she first arrives, Hetty has finished with the figures and she asks for her meeting with the Queen to be scheduled. The next morning, Hetty is sitting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in a very private room in the Palace.

"Before we start," Hetty says, "I must point out to you that there are some words that I believe are much better replaced by their more accurate Yiddish equivalents. If you don’t understand any of my Yiddish words, please don’t hesitate to ask me to translate.

"OK, Queenie, your Majesty, let me begin. I’ve gone through your books with a fine tooth comb and I have come up with some suggestions for you. First of all, you should immediately shtup some gelt into some trust funds for the aineklach because forever you’re not going to live and the inheritance taxes will fress up your estate just like a chazzer. Next, you should remove completely from your Will that shmendrick son of yours. Charles has enough of an estate of his own already in Cornwall to feed the Weimaraner he married and he’s not likely to have any more kids, at least not with her.  Thirdly, you need to move your toches fast in a straight line and set up trusts as soon as you can for the charities you’ve been supporting over the years. Then you need to ……"

But before Hetty can continue, she’s interrupted. "I say, Ms Abrams," says Prince Philip, "on behalf of my wife, I really must insist on a lot more respect from you when you are addressing her Majesty the Queen. Not only that, but you’re also talking to us in a strange language and I have not understood much of what you’ve said to us so far. I would therefore prefer you to speak to us from now onwards in the Queen’s English."

Before Hetty can reply, Queen Elizabeth turns to Prince Philip and says in a scolding tone of voice, "Phillip, please stop with the narrishkeit and let the nice Ms Abrams continue telling me what is best for me to do. Already, from what she’s said about my family so far, she obviously has just the right kind of saychel I need to cover my toches."

### #1855 How women shop

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

Maurice is the owner of a successful shoe shop called METSIEH SHOES. Today, however, he’s looking worried because he recently acquired a job lot of designer branded ladies shoes and so far the shoes have not sold well, probably, he thinks, because of the Credit Crunch. Now he’s worried that if they are not sold quickly, they will never sell and he'll lose his opportunity to make some good money. So he decides to launch a special, high profile, one day sale of designer shoes.  The Press Release, which appeared in all the national and local newspapers, said: -

### #1856 Always tell the truth

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

As you know, Israel is the home of the most fantastic of medical and technical achievements. This time, they’ve invented an affordable lie detecting robot. Moshe, of course, has to have one and buys one at Harrods. Later that afternoon, he’s waiting for his son Benjy to come home from school so that he can show off the robot to his wife Sarah and Benjy at the same time. But Moshe has to wait until just gone 5pm before Benjy makes an appearance.

"So where have you been, Benjy?" asks Moshe. "You’re one-and-a-half hours late."

"Sorry dad," replies Benjy. "I went with some friends to the library to prepare for our weekly Maths test."

At that, the robot switches himself on, turns to Benjy and says, "That statement is not true! You did not go to the library."

"Benjy," says Moshe, "there will be no more lying in my house. This is a lie detecting robot. Where were you really?"

"OK dad, you’ve rumbled me," replies Benjy. "I went to Daniel’s house and watched a film."

"So what did you see?" asks Moshe.

"I saw The Jazz Singer," replies Benjy, "and wasn’t Olivier great as the chazzan?"

Once again the robot switches himself on, turns to Benjy and says, "That statement is not true! You did not see The Jazz Singer."

"So what did you really see," asks Moshe.

Benjy replies, crying, "We saw ‘Sex in the Park,’ dad."

"I’m really very disappointed with you, Benjy," says Moshe. "When I was your age, I would never dream of lying to my parents. I respected them too much."

At that, the robot switches himself on, turns to Moshe and says, "That statement is not true! You regularly lied to your parents."

On hearing this, Sarah says, "How could you tell such a lie to Benjy? After all, he is your son."

At that, the robot switches himself on, turns to Sarah and says, "That statement is not true. Benjy is ………."

NOTE: Moshe is currently making plans to divorce his unfaithful Sarah.

### #1859 Better late than never?

Monty is 40 years old but was never circumcised. So one day he decides to have that operation. His decision making process went along the lines of, "It’s better late than never – and after all, I’ve always wanted to be a 100% Jew."

Two weeks later, he is operated on in a private hospital by doctor Myers. As soon as his surgery is over, Monty is wheeled back to his private ward. As he is recovering from the surgery, one of the nurses asks him how he is feeling.

"I'm OK, thank you - at least I think I am," replies Monty. "I just didn't like what doctor Myers cried out towards the end of my operation."

"So what did he cry out?" asks the nurse.

"Oy gevalt!  Zol Got mir helfen."

### #1861 No problem

Freda meets her friend Betty at Brent Cross Shopping Centre. "I’m really annoyed with myself, Betty," says Freda. "I spent nearly 4 hours last weekend helping out my shul, as I always do. And then I made a monumental mistake."

"Nu, so what did you do?" asks Betty.

"Well," replies Freda, "just before I left the shul to go home and have a shluff, the rabbi came over to me to thank me for my help. And like a fool, I replied, ‘it was no problem, rabbi.’"

"So what was wrong with that?" asks Betty. "I would have said the same thing to him."

"It was wrong," replies Freda, "because the phrase, ‘no problem’ should never be uttered by Jewish women. Firstly, there no such thing to us as a situation that isn’t a problem. And secondly, we should never suggest that we’re not doing someone a favour when we definitely are."

### #1864 What an expert!

[My thanks to Laurence F for the following]

It’s a warm erev shabbes afternoon and Rabbi Landau and Rebbetsin Naomi are relaxing in their kitchen. Rabbi Landau is an expert on astronomy (he’s even got a kind of laboratory set up in his study) and he’s quietly reading some of the latest scientific papers on the subject. Suddenly, from nowhere, a large rock flies at speed through their open kitchen window and lands right in the cholent saucepan which is bubbling away on their gas cooker. They are naturally both very shocked.

When Rebbetsin Naomi has calmed down a bit, she turns to Rabbi Landau and with a worried look asks, "I need a psak. Is our cholent now milchedik or is it still flayshedik? What do you think?"

"Don't worry, darling," replies Rabbi Landau, "I'll take the offending rock out of the cholent and I'll examine it straight away in my laboratory. Then I’ll tell you what I think."

Rabbi Landau returns 30 minutes later and says, "Good news, darling. I am pleased to be able to confirm that our cholent is still flayshedik because the rock is definitely "meteorite."

### #1865 I want to be a plumber

[My thanks to Howard K for the following]

Issy arrives back home from work and to his horror finds his kitchen flooded, with water still pouring out of one of the pipes under his sink. He starts to panic because he doesn’t know any plumber and rushes over to Sam, his next door neighbour, for help.

"Calm down, Issy," says Sam. "I know of a great plumber by the name of Dennis who has done good work for me in the past. He’s very calm, polite and reliable. I’ll ring him right away."

Sam telephones Dennis and 10 minutes later, Dennis is underneath Issy’s sink working on the faulty joint. 30 minutes after he arrives, Dennis has everything under control.

Issy can’t thank him enough. "That was excellent work and you fixed it so quickly and with no fuss. I was expecting it to take much longer."

"It’s all part of my service, sir," replies Dennis.

"So how much do I owe you?" asks Issy.

"For an emergency callout, £90," replies Dennis, "plus 30 minutes of my time at £500 per hour, plus £10 for the parts I had to replace. That comes to £350 in total, sir."

"Oy Vay," says Issy. "£500 per hour? My Harley Street private doctor only charges me £300 per hour when I have to see him, and he’s expensive!"

"Don’t I know it," says Dennis. "That’s what I used to charge my patients when I used to be a Harley Street doctor."

### #1866 The wrong match

Benjy finally gives in. After weeks of nagging by his mother, he agrees to go on a blind date with Judith, the daughter of one of his mother’s friends. He’s going to take her to Minky’s Kosher Diner.

Although his mother tells him that she has a premonition that this will work out well for him, "It will be a shiddach made in heaven," she tells him, Benjy nevertheless asks his friend Tony to call him at the restaurant at 9pm to give him an excuse to leave early if need be.

Benjy meets Judith at the restaurant and very quickly realises that Judith is not the one for him. She shows no interest in anything he talks about – all she does is talk about boring women things like babies, jewellery and shoes. So after about an hour of this, Benjy is pleased to hear his mobile phone ring. He answers it, talks for a short time, then tells Judith, in a very sad voice, "I’ve got to leave right away, Judith. My zaydeh has just died."

Judith looks very pleased to hear this. "Thank goodness for that," she says. "If your zaydeh hadn’t died, mine would have had to have died instead. Goodbye Benjy."

### #1868 The Jewish telephone conversion

(This is a true story, really!)

I have just found a report I wrote way back in January 1972 of my telephone conversation with the Financial Editor (mainly advertising) of the Jewish Chronicle and I thought I would share it with you as it still brings a smile to my face.

The JC was one of my prospects and I was trying to interest them in taking a share price service from my company. At that time, we provided this service to nearly all of the main national and provincial newspapers.

Could such a conversation have taken place other than between two Jewish businessmen?  I started by trying to sell him our service; he nicely switched it to trying to sell me his; and then, when he discovered I was Jewish, he became very warm towards me and talked about initiative, job satisfaction, and a future promise to subscribe and give me first choice.

### #1870 Why is this night different?

Soon it was time for ma nishtana to be read by the youngest one present. As soon as Simon asks, "why is this night different from all other nights," quick as a flash, his older brother Isaac replies, "because mummy cooked."

### #1871 Small is beautiful

[My thanks to Uriah Y for the following]

Rabbi Goldman, rabbi of a synagogue in Birchington, is one of the few rabbis who have not yet found a wife. Nevertheless, his small community like him a lot and hope that one day he’ll find his soul mate. But after many years of no change, the community gets fed up having a bachelor rabbi who can’t answer questions on subjects like, ‘marriage’ or ‘children’ or ‘keeping a family home’, and so they decide to find a bride for him.

They place an advert in the Jewish Chronicle and are pleased when they receive a reply from a Jewish girl living in Fordwich. Her CV and photograph seem to show that she is not only religious, but also beautiful and intelligent. And they are doubly pleased because Fordwich is not too far away from Birchington, both being in the county of Kent.

To be on the safe side they decide it’s important to check out the girl.  First of all, they write to the Kent Jewish community, but their reply doesn’t really help them. So they come to the conclusion that they will have to send someone to Fordwich to check out the girl’s credentials first hand – and they send Moshe.

Moshe drives to Fordwich the very next day and spends a few days quietly and confidentially checking out their potential rebbitsin. He then returns to Birchington to tell his council what he has discovered.

"Nu, Moshe, what have you found out for us? What is this girl really like?" asks the chairman.

"Well I spoke with many of her family and a number of her friends, both male and female," replies Moshe, “and then I spoke with the girl herself. Everyone was very open and honest with me."

"Enough already with this idle chat, Moshe," says the chairman, "what we want to know is, will she or won’t she make a good shiddach for our rabbi?"

"OK," replies Moshe, "I’ll come straight to the point. There is a minor problem. The girl is definitely clever, she’s definitely beautiful, she’s definitely religious, and she’s definitely slept with half of Fordwich."

"Oy vay iz meer," reply the council in unison, slapping their foreheads with the palm of their hands.

"But there’s no need to worry too much," continues Moshe, "Fordwich is only a very small town."

### #1872 Why so happy and so long?

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Betty and Hyman are celebrating their goldeneh khasseneh at home with their family and friends. During the afternoon, Isaac, one of their friends, goes over to them and says, "Mazeltov! You two look so happy together. I hope you don’t mind me asking, but how have you both managed to stay so happy and so loving for so long?"

Hyman replies first, "Well, as far as I’m concerned, I’ve tried very hard in all this time never to be selfish. After all, as my dear mother used to say, there’s no ‘i’ in the word 'marriage’."

Then Betty has her say. "Well," she says, smiling, "I look upon it differently. As far as I’m concerned, I have never tried to correct Hyman’s spelling."

### #1873 Do I want kosher food?

After his business went mechuleh, followed quickly by his wife divorcing him, and then losing his house to her in a messy divorce case, Arnold finally has his mental breakdown. It’s a serious one and he has to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for the insane. As soon as he arrives, he insists not only on kosher food, but also on eating it in the canteen together with all the other patients. After a lot of negotiating (he’s the only Jewish patient), and with much help from Rabbi Landau, the hospital finally agrees to pay for kosher food to be served to Arnold in their canteen.

Some weeks later, Rabbi Landau decides to visit Arnold to see how he’s getting on. As it’s lunch time, Rabbi Landau goes straight to the canteen. He looks around for Arnold and is shocked when he sees him at a corner table with some other patients. Arnold has a smile on his face and has in front of him a large plate of bacon, sausage and eggs which he’s eating with gusto. "So, Arnold," says Rabbi Landau, "is this how you repay us? I’m very surprised at what I’m seeing. I thought you said you had to eat kosher? We went to a lot of trouble and expense arranging kosher food for you, yet here you are obviously enjoying a non-kosher meal."

"You shouldn’t be surprised, rabbi," replies Arnold. "Surely you remember that I’m meshugga!"

### #1876 Parting is such sweet sorrow

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Benjy and Issy have just left shul and are walking home together. They talk about many things before their conversation moves onto their wives. Benjy asks, "So Issy, do you have a nice wife? What’s she like?"

"Estelle’s OK I suppose," replies Issy.

"That’s not a very positive answer, Issy," says Benjy. "Let me put it another way. I bet you have to think twice before you leave Estelle alone at night."

"You’re so right on that one," replies Issy. "First of all, I have to think of a good excuse to leave the house. And when I find one, I then have to think of a good reason why she can’t go out with me."

### #1878 But that’s what you said to me

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Kitty loves Cindy, her Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, very much. Either she’s got Cindy on her lap or else she’s carrying Cindy around the house in her arms. And she talks to the dog incessantly, just as if Cindy were human - and much of what she says is in Yiddish, even. But the downside of all this care and attention is that Cindy just hates it when Kitty goes out without her. As soon as Kitty puts on her coat, Cindy barks a lot and looks like she wants to cry.

Today, the plumber Kitty booked some time ago to change a few radiator valves arrives. He’s a nice middle-aged gentleman and he informs Kitty that he needs about 90 minutes to change the valves. He then starts work in the front room.

As Kitty has a bit of shopping to do, she puts on her coat and walks to the front door. She then turns around and there, as expected, is Cindy sitting on the stairs barking, with a sad, sad look on her face.

Kitty shouts over to Cindy, "It’s all right, my little haymisheh, I’m just going to the butchers and I won’t be long. But if you’re not good while I’m away, bubbeleh, I’ll give you such a shtup when I get back. So please be good.  Ich hob deer leib."

And then, from the front room, a voice answers, "Thank you, I love you too. And of course I’ll be good until you return. I’m too old for a shtup."

### #1879 How it is; and how we got there

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth and populated the Earth with broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and green, yellow and red vegetables of all kinds, so that Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.  But Satan created Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and Krispy Creme Donuts. And Satan said, "You want chocolate with that?" And Man said, "Yes!" and Woman said, "And as long as you're at it, add some sprinkles." And they gained 10 pounds. And Satan smiled.

### #1880 Saychel versus a biker

A biker stops at a garage in a small Kent village to see whether they can quickly repair a problem he’s having with his bike. When he learns that they won’t be able to fix it for a few hours, he tells them that he lives nearby and he’ll pick it up later in the afternoon. On his walk home he stops by the farm shop and buys a goose and two chickens. He then goes into the hardware store and buys a bucket and an anvil. As he leaves the store, struggling with his purchases, he sees 65 year old Becky wandering around in a daze and crying.

"What’s the matter lady?" he asks.

Becky looks up and sees this handsome tattooed hunk of a man smiling at her in a friendly way. She immediately stops crying. "I’m lost," replies Becky, quickly composing herself. "I’ve only just moved into this village and today, for the first time, I’ve walked here to do some shopping. But I can’t remember how to get back to my house and I don’t know what to do."

"Where do you live?" he asks.

"179 Bush Avenue," replies Becky.

The biker says, "You’re in luck lady. As I live quite near Bush Avenue, I’ll be glad to escort you to your new home. But I won’t be able to walk very fast as I’m having difficulty holding my shopping, as you can see."

"So why don’t you put the anvil inside the bucket, carry the goose in your left hand, carry the bucket plus anvil in your right hand, and hold one of the chickens under each arm?" suggests Becky.

"That’s a good idea, lady, thank you," he says, doing as she suggested. Then he starts to escort Becky home. Becky can’t believe that she is being accompanied by such a good looking man.

But only a few minutes into their walk, he suddenly says to her, "Let’s take a short cut down this alley, lady. It will save 5 minutes of our time."

On hearing this, Becky says, "Hold on a minute. I’m a lonely widow with no husband to help defend me. How do I know that when we’re in the alley you won’t grab me, hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and ravish me?"

The biker laughs out loud. "Jesus, lady, I’m carrying a bucket, an anvil, two chickens, and a goose. How on earth do you think I could hold you up against the wall and do that to you?"

Becky quickly replies, "So put the goose on the ground, place the bucket over him and put the anvil on top of the bucket. I’ll hold the two chickens."

### #1881 I suppose not

Miriam is an accountant and hasn’t been able to find the time to look for a husband. So her parents arrange for Morris the shadchen to find their daughter a nice husband. A few days later, Morris tells Miriam that he has found the perfect match for her. "Howard comes from a really fine family," Morris tells her. "He’s a lovely man, well educated and most importantly, he’s wealthy."

Miriam quickly agrees to go out to tea with him.

On her return, she briefs Morris on her findings. "Howard was friendly and relaxed with me," she says, "and as you say, he’s very educated and knew a lot about everything. But he’s far from the handsome man I’m looking for. In fact Howard is, how can I put it, a meeskeit and I’m afraid he’s therefore a ‘no go’ as far as I’m concerned."

Unwilling to loose business without putting up a fight, Morris says, "Hold on a minute, Miriam, I don’t want you to make a hasty decision that you might later regret. I’ve seen Howard and I agree with you that although he is ugly, thank God he’s not a klutz, nor a vilde mensh, nor a nebbish. Nor is he a grober, or a pisher, or a dumkop. These are all points in Howard’s favour. And there are other important aspects to this man that you must consider."

"OK," replies Miriam, "so what are these other aspects?"

"While you’re at work all day balancing you clients’ profit and loss accounts, will you be looking at Howard?" Morris asks.

"No, I suppose not," replies Miriam.

"And when you come home after work," asks Morris, "will you be looking at Howard while you prepare the evening meal and then while you both eat?"

"No, I suppose not," replies Miriam.

"And when you go to bed at night," asks Morris, "will you be looking at Howard in the dark?"

"No, I suppose not," replies Miriam.

"And will you be looking at Howard whilst you’re asleep?" asks Morris.

"No, I suppose not," replies Miriam.

"And during weekends, when you have children - and please God may you be blessed with many - would you spend your time at home looking at Howard instead of taking your children on outings?" asks Morris.

"No, I suppose not," replies Miriam.

"Well then," says Morris, it’s clear to me that marrying such a mensh won’t be as much of a hardship as you think it will be. You’ll hardly be looking at him and there’s no reason not to marry him. Shall I make the arrangements now?"

### #1882 When I grow up, I want to be …..

Ruth takes one look inside her 10 year old son Daniel’s bedroom and immediately goes downstairs to confront him. "Daniel," she says to him, "I thought you told me that you had thoroughly cleaned your room. I’ve just taken a look at it and it’s still a big mess. What have you got to say about it?"

"I really don’t know why you’re making such a fuss, mum," Daniel replies. "After all, I never actually told you my room was clean."

"Oh but you did, Daniel," says Ruth.

"No, mum, you’re wrong there," says Daniel. "What I actually told you at 5.10pm this afternoon was, ‘OK mum, I’m done with the cleaning of my room’."

Ruth can’t help but smile. "OK smarty pants," she says, "I should have remembered that you want to be a lawyer when you grow up. You’re obviously going to make a brilliant lawyer."

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Benjy, Victor and Morris meet up after work and go to Minky’s Wine Bar, their favourite venue. Thirty minutes after sitting down, Benjy suddenly announces, "Apologies, guys, but I have to leave early tonight to prepare for an important presentation I’m giving at work tomorrow. But do carry on without me."

"We will, don’t worry," the other two reply, smiling.

Benjy gets up from their table and leaves. But 10 minutes later, Victor notices that Benjy has left his mobile phone on his chair.

"What do you think we should do about Benjy’s phone, Morris?" asks Victor.

"I think the best thing to do," replies Morris, "is to ring Benjy’s mum now and tell her that we have his phone and we’ll hand it to him tomorrow at work."

"Good idea," says Victor, as he starts to scroll through the phone’s saved numbers. When he finds an entry labelled, "MUMMY," Victor makes the call.

"Hello Mrs Levy," says Victor, "could you tell Benjy that he left his phone at Minky’s tonight and I’ll bring it into work for him tomorrow."

"Don't worry," says Mrs Levy, "I'll take care of it right away. Thanks for letting me know."

A few minutes later, Benjy’s mobile phone rings and Victor answers it.

It was Mrs Levy but before he could say anything, she says, "Benjy, darling, you’ve been a careless boy tonight - you left your mobile phone at Minky’s!"

### #1884 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

One day, Isaac and Ruth are doing some shopping in Waitrose supermarket. As they pass the beers, wines and spirit section, Isaac picks up a pack of a dozen bottles of Maccabi Beer and puts it in their trolley.

"Why do you need so much beer?" asks Ruth.

"Because they are on a special offer of only £6.00 for 12 bottles," replies Isaac.

"Please put them back Isaac," says Ruth. "We can’t afford them – we’re in a credit crunch, don’t forget."

Soon after, they are passing the cosmetics section and Ruth picks up a jar of face cream and puts it in their trolley.

"Why do you need another jar of face cream?" asks Isaac.

"Because it’s on a special offer of only £9 instead of its regular price of £12," replies Ruth. "It’s my usual brand and this face cream makes me look beautiful."

"But to me a dozen bottles of Maccabi Beer also make you look beautiful, and the beer is cheaper!"

### #1887 The clever Rabbi

Hymie loves his dog Cindy very much. One night, as he and his wife Betty are having a late night drink, Betty says to him, "Hymie, I’ve been meaning to tell you something for some time."

"So tell me already," says Hymie.

"I think you spend too much time talking to Cindy," Betty replies. "She can’t possibly understand you and she certainly can’t understand the Yiddish expressions you use."

"But she can," says Hymie, "she’s a Jewish dog!"

Betty laughs out loud. "Don’t be silly," she says, "of course Cindy’s not Jewish. Dogs can’t be Jewish!"

Next day, Hymie takes Cindy with him to see his rabbi.

"So Hymie," says Rabbi Gold, "how are you keeping these days and how can I help you?"

"I’m fine thank you rabbi," replies Hymie. "I’m here to ask you whether my dog Cindy could be a Jewish dog. After all, Betty is Jewish, my two sons Paul and David are Jewish, and my lovely daughter Rachel is Jewish. But how can I tell if Cindy is Jewish?"

"That’s a good question, Hymie," replies Rabbi Gold, picking up his phone. "I’m going to ask my assistant Maurice Katz to join us. He might be able to help us.

But when Maurice comes into the Rabbi’s office, Cindy goes wild and chases after Maurice, barking loudly.

"Well Hymie," says Rabbi Gold, "that’s proof enough for me. Cindy is indeed a Jewish dog."

"But how did you arrive at that conclusion so quickly?" asks Hymie, smiling happily.

"Because she just chased Katz," replies Rabbi Gold.

### #1890 The Hebrew lesson

8 year old Isaac has been going to his shul’s Hebrew classes for 5 months but is struggling to understand the words. Like many other children of his age, he finds it difficult to concentrate on anything other then his mobile phone, his computer games and his adventure DVDs. Today, Rabbi Bloom, his teacher, is having a particularly difficult time with Isaac.

"So Isaac," asks Rabbi Bloom, "do you remember what the Hebrew word isha means?"

"I can’t remember, rabbi," replies Isaac, looking embarrassed.

Rabbi Bloom decides to help Isaac as much as he can. "Let me give you a hint, then," says Rabbi Bloom. "Just watch my lips. Isha means a w…"

"A witch?" suggests Isaac.

"Now don’t be silly, Isaac," says Rabbi Bloom, "try again. Isha means a w…"

"A wizard, maybe or a werewolf?" suggests Isaac.

"No, dummkopf," says Rabbi Bloom, getting a bit angry. "Don’t be silly. Please concentrate.  I’ll give you one more chance. Isha means a w…"

"A Walkman?" replies Issac.

"Just where do you think a Walkman fits into the stories from the Old Testament?" groans Rabbi Bloom.

Then he tries one more approach. "Isaac, Isha is something your father has, your uncle has, and what I too have. Now do you know what isha means?"

"Yes," replies Isaac, "I know now. Isha is a wart."

### #1891 Learning to be charitable

[My thanks to Shlomo for the following]

Monty is not a happy man and goes to see Rabbi Levy for some help. "Rabbi," he says, "I’m just not happy these days and I don’t know what to do about it."

"OK, Monty," says Rabbi Levy, "let me ask you a few questions. Is it a lack of money that’s causing your unhappiness?"

"No, rabbi," replies Monty, "it’s certainly not money. I’m a very wealthy man."

"So, do you donate any of your money to charity?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Well …  actually …no," stutters Monty. "I’ve always thought of doing so, but I’ve never managed to do it."

"I think this might be your problem, Monty," says Rabbi Levy.  "Being mean with one’s money is actually a sin. It nearly always makes most Jews feel quite bad about themselves, and it’s a feeling that only goes away when something is given back to society."

"But that’s easy for you to say, rabbi," says Monty. "I’ve never in my life ever given money to anyone other than my close family. The thought of giving money to unknown people via a charity is alien to me. It will make me ill."

"That might be so, Monty," says Rabbi Levy, "but unless you do, you’ll remain miserable all your life. So this is what I want you to do. As soon as you leave here, I want you to give £50 as a present to the first person you see in the street. Once you have done this, I promise you it will become much easier for you to start donating money to worthy charities."

Monty leaves the rabbi’s house and within minutes of walking down the street, he comes up to a heavily made up, quite attractive lady standing by a fence. She’s wearing a leather mini skirt and high heels. So very reluctantly, Monty opens his wallet, takes out £50, gives it to her and says, “Here you are lady, this is for you."

The lady looks at Monty, then says, "What makes you think £50 is enough, you cheapskate. You have to give me £100."

"But the rabbi told me £50 was enough," says Monty.

"Well the rabbi would say that, wouldn’t he?" she says. "£50 is OK only when you’re a regular of mine - like he is."

### #1892 The problem solver

Monty meets up with his friend Cyril in Brent Cross Shopping Centre. "Nu Cyril, why the glum face?" asks Monty. "It’s not like you to look so sad."

"Oy Vay iz meer, do I have a problem," replies Cyril. "The Credit Crunch is killing me – I just have to raise £200,000 in the next fortnight or else my 20-year-old business is doomed."

"Don’t worry, my friend," says Monty, "You can easily overcome your problem."

"How can I do that?" asks Cyril.

"Here’s what you do," replies Monty. "Go out into the streets and sell 200,000 shoe-laces for £1 each."

"But I don’t have any shoe-laces," says Cyril.

"Oy, then you have a problem," says Monty.

### #1893 The wise Judge

[My thanks to Joe D, Asher P, and Frank R for the following]

Louis is very frum and has just moved into an expensive apartment on the 5th floor of a high rise block of flats in Hampstead. But when he builds a succah on his balcony, all trouble breaks loose. His non-Jewish neighbours claim that his succah is so ugly and so visible from the street below that the values of their apartments are being negatively affected by it. So they take him to court and the case is heard in front of Judge Goldbloom just one day before the start of the 8 day festival of Succoth. Those who know Judge Goldbloom say he is a very wise man.

Louis is very worried that if he loses the case and he’s asked to remove his succah, he won’t have time to make alternative arrangements.

After hearing both sides’ arguments, Judge Goldbloom looks at Louis and says, "I’m surprised at you. You’re living in an expensive block of flats and it’s therefore expected of you to maintain a high standard of external building work. You had no right to put up such an eyesore on this lovely block of flats without obtaining a suitable building permit. I must therefore rule that either you remove the succah or else I will have no option but to fine you £500. You have exactly eight days, starting from tomorrow, to remove it. Next case!"

### #1894 Pleasures of the flesh

It’s soon to be Daniel’s barmitzvah and Rabbi Levy, as he always does two weeks before the event, invites Daniel and his parents to a dinner at his house. During dinner, Daniel can’t help noticing that Rabbi Levy is putting a great amount of salt on his food. So Daniel quietly asks his father why.

"It’s because the rabbi is a saint, Daniel," replies his father, almost whispering, "and all his pleasures are spiritual. For example, he avoids enjoying the food he eats by putting lots of salt on it to kill any nice taste."

Daniel turns his head slowly away from his father and takes a closer look at Rabbi Levy’s wife. Daniel might be only 12 today but that doesn’t stop him noticing that she is a beautiful lady with an attractive figure and a very pretty face.

Daniel must have been staring at the rabbi’s wife for a while because suddenly his father says to him, "Please don't stare at the rabbi's wife, Daniel, it's very rude."

"Sorry dad," says Daniel, "I was only trying to calculate how much salt the rabbi would need to take in order to have no pleasures at all."

### #1895 Morning and evening treatment

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Howard goes to see his doctor because he’s been feeling very tired of late and seems to have lost his stamina. Howard takes his wife Freda with him.

After an examination, Doctor Myers says it’s not too serious and gives Howard a prescription for some pills. He then tells Freda that for the next month, she should make sure that Howard not only takes one pill every morning, but also drinks a glass of red Carmel wine with his dinner every evening.

After three weeks have gone by, Freda bumps into Doctor Myers whilst out shopping. Doctor Myers immediately asks her, "So how is Howard doing with his wine and pills treatment?"

"About 50/50, I think," replies Freda. "He's about 2 weeks behind with the taking of his pills, but he’s made up for this by being about 2 weeks ahead with the Carmel red wine."

### #1896 The two prayers

Laurence and Nathan have been arguing with each other for many months, and they have recently even taken to shouting at each other in shul. But with Yom Kippur coming up, Rabbi Bloom doesn’t want to hear them arguing during the service. So he calls them both over to his house.

With both of them standing in front of him, Rabbi Bloom says, "Listen to me, both of you. You now must, and I mean must, make peace with each other. God does not want two of his children arguing in front of him all the time. You will soon be going to shul to pray for God to forgive you your sins. But how can you do this if you can’t first of all forgive your fellow man?"

Laurence and Nathan are moved by Rabbi Bloom’s plea. Laurence looks at Nathan and moves towards him. Nathan opens his arms and soon they are both hugging each other. They then promise not to fight and argue any more.

Two weeks later in shul, as soon as the Kol Nidrei service finishes, Nathan goes over to Laurence, shakes his hand warmly, and says, "Laurence, just to let you know that I prayed for you tonight. I prayed everything that you prayed for me."

Laurence replies, "Oy Vay, you’re starting up again already?"

### #1897 The choice of reward

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Rabbi Shmuel is leading a bible study group at his shul when all of a sudden, an angel appears. The Angel says to the rabbi, "RabbiShmuel. You are an example to all of your fellow men. You are totally unselfish; your behaviour is faultless; your study of Judaism is extensive; and your charity giving is exemplary. So, in return for being such a mensh, I am going to offer you a choice of reward. You can either have infinite wealth, infinite health, or infinite wisdom. What will it be, Rabbi Shmuel? Whatever you choose will be immediately granted."

Without any hesitation whatsoever, Rabbi Shmuel replies, "I would love to have infinite wisdom."

"Mazeltov to you, Rabbi Shmuel," says the Angel. "It’s done.  Enjoy!"

The Angel then disappears as quickly as it had appeared. For a few minutes there was a stunned silence in the study group. No one could believe what had just happened in front of their eyes. Then one of the study group broke the silence.

"Rabbi Shmuel," he asks, "why don’t you test out your new found wisdom right away? Say something really wise to us, rabbi."

Rabbi Shmuel replies, "Oy vay, I should have taken the money."

### #1898  Fair exchange

Today was the day Naomi has been waiting for – her wedding day. At the commencement of the shul service, her father is escorting her down the aisle to the chuppah. She looks absolutely stunning and all eyes are on her. They reach the khassen, but just before her father moves away from them, Naomi smiles and places something in his hand.

Those in the front row see what is handed over and begin to quietly laugh – in return for giving his daughter away in marriage, she gives her father back his credit card!

### #1900 The home visit

[My thanks to Lynn F for the following]

Benjamin has just completed his first year at Manchester University and rings his mother Miriam. "Mum," he says, "if it’s OK with you, I’ll be coming home next weekend to see you and dad."

"If it’s OK with me?" she replies, crying. "Oh Benjy, of course it will be OK with me. You give me so much naches. I’m thrilled you’re coming. I just can’t wait to see you again. I’ll make you all you favourite food. But please drive carefully."

When the call is over, Miriam immediately starts getting his old room ready for him. The weekend quickly arrives and all goes well. There are many things they talk about, but then she asks him, "So, my boychick, you have a nice girlfriend already in Manchester?"

Benjamin was prepared for this question. He knew it would come up during his visit.  "Well, mum," he replies, "I have some good news and some bad news. What do you want to hear first?"

"So give me the bad news first," she replies, looking very worried.

"I'm gay, mum," he replies.

"Oy vay!" cries Miriam, "so tell me the good news before I faint on the floor."

"I'm in love with such a nice doctor, mum," he replies.

### #1901 An eye for a good painting

[My thanks to Geoff E. for the following]

Isaac is fast becoming one of the great Jewish painters of his time and his works of art are much sought after. But recently he’s been having trouble with the vision in his right eye and following advice from several of his friends, he books an appointment to see Sir David Minkovitch, a top ophthalmic surgeon.

Three weeks later, following a series of tests carried out on his eye, Isaac is sitting opposite Sir David awaiting the great man’s verdict. He is dreading what he might hear.

Sir David looks at Isaac and says, "I’m sorry to have to inform you that you have a serious glaucoma in your right eye."

"Oy vay," cries Isaac.

"But all is not lost, Isaac," continues Sir David. "I’m almost 100% sure that if we act immediately, we can save the sight in your eye."

"I’ll be eternally grateful to you if you can do that, Sir David," says Isaac.

One month following the operation, Isaac has almost regained full vision in his right eye and starts work on his first painting since the operation - a very flattering portrait of Sir David which Isaac decides to show inside the pupil of a large eye. Three months later the finished painting is delivered and Sir David is immediately touched by this wonderful gift. But as he says to his wife soon afterwards, "It’s very unusual to see a portrait painted inside a specialist’s area of expertise – in my case an eye. Thank goodness I’m not Sir Garry Rokensand."

"Why is that, darling?" asks his wife.

"Because Sir Garry is a proctologist," replies Sir David, "and if Isaac had needed an operation on his backside, rather than his eye, what would Isaac have painted to thank Sir Garry?"

### #1902 Share and share alike

Harry and Arnold are partners in their accountancy firm. One morning, Harry goes into Arnold’s office and asks, "There’s a rumour going round the firm, Arnold, that you’re having an affair with Betty, our new receptionist. Is this true?"

"Yes it is," replies Arnold. "I took her to the Ritz Hotel last night, and I have to say that she’s so much better in bed compared to my wife."

"OK," says Harry, smiling, "but don’t let our staff find out that one of our departments is run by a randy partner."

One month later, Arnold goes into Harry’s office and asks, "There’s a new rumour going round the firm, Harry, that you’re having an affair with Betty. Is this true?"

"Yes, it certainly is," replies Harry, getting all excited. "And I have to say that you were absolutely right. Betty is so much better in bed compared to your wife."

### #1903 Value for money

A second, longer Channel Tunnel joining the UK to France is agreed by Parliament and Lawrence Gold, a building contractor from Golders Green, immediately tenders for the digging of the tunnel. And guess what? He wins the job. As soon as the story hits the newspapers, his best friend Simon goes round to Lawrence’s house.

"Mazeltov, Lawrence," he says, "but I’m surprised by the news this morning. Just how do you expect to dig a tunnel nearly 40 miles long?"

"It won’t be a problem," replies Lawrence. "It’s already planned. I’m going to start with a team on the UK side and my son Paul is going to take a team to France to start on the French side. Then both teams will start digging and we’ll just keep on digging until we meet in the middle. Simple."

"But Lawrence," says Simon, "the papers have interviewed top civil engineers and they all say that by far the hardest part of the digging work will be its directional aspects – the two teams will find it extremely difficult to be able to meet exactly to the inch, distance-wise and depth-wise."

"I’ve already thought of that, my friend," replies Lawrence. "The answer to this problem was a central part of my tender document and frankly, it’s why I got the job. I’ve agreed with our government that if my two teams are unable to meet, they will keep on digging until they reach land. And then the government will have two tunnels for the price of one."

"I’ve just come back from the doctors," says Miriam. "My Barry is not a well man."

"Oy, what’s the matter with him?" asks Ruth.

"Well, you know I keep on telling you how forgetful Barry always is?" replies Miriam. "Well, the doctor has just told us that Barry is now showing all the signs of the onset of Alzheimer’s."

"Oh I’m so sorry to hear that, Miriam." says Ruth.

"But there is some good news," says Miriam. "It should be a very smooth transition."

### #1908 I’ll do my utmost

Not long after attending her grandson Paul’s 12th birthday party, Rebecca has a heart attack. Whilst in hospital, she starts to plead with her cardiologist. "Oy, doctor David," she says, "you’ve just got to keep me alive for the next 12 months so that I can attend my bubbeleh grandson Paul’s barmitzvah. He’s my first grandchild."

"I’ll do my utmost to get you there, Rebecca," says doctor David.

"Thank you doctor," says Rebecca. And 12 months later, Rebecca does indeed attend Paul’s barmitzvah.

Ten years later, whilst Rebecca is seeing doctor David for a check-up, she says, "I have another request, doctor."

"And what do you need me to do this time, Rebecca?" he asks.

"In a year’s time, please God, my grand-daughter Suzy is marrying a lovely, lovely, man, a real mensh, and I desperately want to attend their wedding. So please, doctor, please ensure that I stay alive long enough to attend their wedding."

"I’ll do my utmost to get you there, Rebecca," says doctor David.

"Thank you doctor," says Rebecca. And 12 months later, Rebecca does indeed attend Suzy’s wedding.

Over the next twenty years, Rebecca regularly visits doctor David for check-ups, and she always religiously follows his advice. Then one day, she suddenly phones doctor David. "Hello doctor," she says. "It’s Rebecca here."

"Are you OK Rebecca?" asks doctor David, sounding worried. "Is anything the matter?"

"Nothing’s the matter doctor," replies Rebecca, "I think everything is OK and I'm feeling fine. But I’m calling because I have another request to make. Do you remember when you enabled me to attend my grandson’s barmitzvah?"

"Yes Rebecca, I do," he replies.

"And do you remember when you enabled me to attend my grand-daughter’s wedding?"

"Yes Rebecca, I do," he replies.

"And are you aware that I've just celebrated my 80th birthday?" asks Rebecca.

"Yes Rebecca, I know," he replies.

"Well, I’m ringing you because I’ve just taken delivery of a new mattress," says Rebecca.

"Mazeltov," says doctor David, "but why are you phoning me about your mattress?"

"Because," replies Rebecca, "the mattress came with a 20 year guarantee!"

### #1910 An old age problem

Two elderly ladies, Miriam and Naomi, meet for the first time for many, many years and decide to catch up on things over a coffee and a bagel at Minky’s Kosher Snacks.

"So, Miriam," says Naomi, "it’s been a long time. How have you been getting on?"

"Oy, Naomi," replies Miriam, "you shouldn’t have asked me that question. I think old age is terrible. I’m 75 years old and I’m 5 foot 3 inches tall. Yet when I was in my twenties, I was nearly 5 foot 6 inches tall."

"I know exactly how you feel," says Naomi. "When I was twenty-one, I was 5 foot 5 inches tall. But now I’m nearing eighty, I’m only 5 foot 2 inches tall. Old age really sucks."

Miriam and Naomi do not know that sitting right behind them is Rabbi Levy. As he gets up to leave, Rabbi Levy says to them, "Ladies, I wish you long life. Please God you should both live to 4 foot eleven inches tall."

### #1911 A burning question

As soon as Moses is given the Ten Commandments by God on the top of Mount Sinai, he immediately takes them down to show his people. After much discussion with his elders, Moses is asked to go back up Mount Sinai to ask God for clarification of an important issue. So although tired, Moses once again makes the long and hard trek to the top of Mount Sinai. And there, by the burning bush, he kneels and prays to God.

"Oh Mighty God, King of the Universe," prays Moses, "your people have asked me to raise a very important question with you relating to the Ten Commandments."

"And what is this important question that my people ask of me?" asks God.

"Oh mighty God," replies Moses, "they have instructed me to ask you whether the Ten Commandments are listed in priority sequence."

### #1912 I’m so tired

[My thanks to AK (aka the ‘alter kocker’) for the following]

Daniel, one of the partners of Minky Tailors, is finding business very stressful - and the Credit Crunch doesn’t make matters any easier. Soon he finds himself unable to sleep at night and begins to arrive at work looking very tired and haggard. So he decides that from now on, when he returns home from work, he would try a different way to get a good night’s sleep. He begins to listen to classical music but that does no good. He tries drinking hot milk, but that doesn’t work either. He takes hot baths - gornisht. He even gets sleeping pills from his doctor, but they just give him greps. Nothing seems to work for Daniel.

One morning, as a last resort, he goes over to Harry, one of his older members of staff, and says, "Oy Vay, Harry. I just can’t sleep at night and nothing I try seems to work. I’m oysgemitchet. If I don’t find a solution soon, I’m going to go meshugga. Do you know of any older remedies that might help me?"

"Well," replies Harry, "why not try one of the oldest remedies around, one that everyone has heard of?"

"Nu? So tell me already. What remedy is that?" asks Daniel.

"Counting sheep," replies Harry, smiling. "It always works for me."

"Oy, what a dum kopf I am," says Daniel, hitting himself on his forehead with the palm of his hand. "I forgot all about counting sheep. I’m going to try it out tonight. Thanks for your help, Harry."

Next morning, Daniel arrives at work looking just as bad as ever. He immediately goes over to Harry and says, "I counted sheep last night just like you said, but it didn’t work. And Oy how I counted sheep! I counted three thousand of them without getting in the least bit tired. So I tried something different. I began shearing the sheep, but that didn’t work either - I just stayed wide awake. But I still didn’t give up. I dyed all the wool I’d just sheared, then spun it and made beautiful woollen overcoats from it.  Do you know how tiring it is making three thousand overcoats?  But I thought it was working when I became so exhausted that I began nodding off. But then it all went wrong."

"Why, what happened?" asks Harry.

"I stayed up all night worrying about where I could get three thousand silk linings."

"Oh, I thought for one moment that you were ill," says Yankel, smiling. "It’s not a problem. In such circumstances, you will just have to pee into the pocket of the man in front of you. Everyone does it these days."

"Don’t be meshugga, Yankel," says Shmeral, "he’s bound to feel what I’m doing and when he does, he’s likely to kill me."

"Well did you feel it when I peed into your pocket no more than 5 minutes ago?" says Yankel.

Hetty is 71 today and as she’s gathering up the many birthday cards that have just been delivered by the postman, she notices amongst them a letter from the Courts of Justice. It’s a notice for Hetty to do Jury Service. On the letter, it says:

IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE REASON NOT TO SERVE ON A JURY, PLEASE CONTACT US

So Hetty immediately rings the number on the form.

"Hello, how can I help," says the voice on the phone.

"I’ve just received a notice to do jury service and I have to tell you that I’m 71 years old and I don’t have to do this anymore."

"OK," says the voice, "I’ll send you an exemption form for you to complete and return to us."

"But I already did that last year," says Hetty.

"Well you have to do this every year," says the voice.

"Why?" says Hetty. "Do you think I get younger each year?

"So, gorgeous," he says, "how is the office managing without me?"

"Things are not going perfectly," she replies. "I have some bad news and some good news for you. What do you want me to tell you first?"

"OK," says Isaac, "not to worry. Why don’t you tell me the bad news first and get it out the way?"

"Well then," says Ruth, "two income tax inspectors arrived first thing this morning and insisted I give them every piece of financial information about the Company. I had no choice but to give them everything they asked for. Then as soon as they had left, your largest customer phoned in and said that his business was so bad that he’s decided to cancel his recent order with you. Halifax Building Society then phoned and gave me a message to pass on to you. They said that they had no option but to re-possess your Hampstead house. And then, if that wasn’t enough, your wife dropped by only 10 minutes ago with your divorce papers. She told me to get you to sign them as soon as you returned to the office. She said she's after at least 50% of everything you have."

"Oy veh iz meer," says Isaac, "so what’s the good news?"

Bursting out with great joy and happiness, Ruth replies, "Oh my darling Isaac, we’re going to have a baby!"

### #1920 Flattery will get you nowhere

Rabbi Gold is leaving Hendon shul to become rabbi of a shul in Manchester and today’s service is the last he’s leading at Hendon. Immediately the service ends, he goes over to the exit and starts to shake hands with the congregation as they leave the shul.

Freda, an elderly lady, is one of the last to leave and as she shakes Rabbi Gold’s hand, she says to him, "We’ll miss you rabbi. Your successor just won't be as good as you."

Feeling rather flattered, Rabbi Gold replies, "Oh don’t be silly. I’m sure he will be just as good as me."

"But I really mean it," says Freda. "Since I've been a member of Hendon shul, I’ve been under the leadership of four different rabbis and I can honestly tell you that each new rabbi, including yourself, has always been much worse than the previous one."

### #1922 Giving the wrong image

Peter, a Coca Cola salesman, returns home from his assignment in Israel very disappointed. He immediately goes to see his boss.

"So Peter," asks his boss, "why weren't you successful with the Israelis?"

"When I got sent to Israel to increase our Coca Cola sales," replies Peter, "I was confident that I would be able to succeed even though I couldn’t speak Hebrew."

"So what did you do to get round the language problem?" asks his boss.

"I decided to convey our message to the Israelis via a Picture Poster campaign," replies Peter, "and after a week of effort, I came up with the Israeli Poster. Although having no text on it, this Poster was able to strongly put across our message using just three high definition images. These images, when viewed sequentially, clearly told the Coca Cola story."

"So what were these three images, Peter?" asks his boss.

"The left hand picture - the first image," replies Peter, "shows a man lying in the hot desert sand, totally exhausted and close to fainting. The middle picture - the second image, shows the man drinking Coca Cola. And the right hand picture - the third image, shows the man totally refreshed and happy."

"So what did you then do?" asks the boss.

"We printed tens of thousands of the posters," replies Peter, "and got them pasted up all over Israel."

"That should have worked very well for us," says the boss. "So what went wrong, Peter?"

"I didn’t realize," replies Peter, "that Jewish people read from right to left. So the pictures gave the totally opposite message to the one I planned."

Howard has just finished reading an article in the Jewish Chronicle about fathers, genetics, and the intelligence of children. He turns to his wife Judith and says, "Darling, I’ve just read an article that says something I’ve believed in for a long time."

"So what does this article say, Howard?" asks Judith, trying to look interested.

"It says that scientific evidence now points to the fact that the intelligence of a father often proves a stumbling block to his son."

"Thank God for that," says Judith. "It means that there is nothing standing in the way for our little Paul to be a great success in the future."

### #1927 The Wonders of Science

[My thanks to Uriah for the following]

One of the longest existing problems in the Jewish food world is at last resolved. The Minkovsky Organisation, a new start-up company in Tel Aviv, discovers how to manufacture kosher knaydlach without the touch of human hands.

Straight away the required factory is built and within months there is enormous demand all over the world for their exciting new product. Everyone is asking for packets of KUBdoubleH (which I’m sure readers know means - Knaydlach Untouched By Human Hand).

Naturally, as soon as they hear about it, the Japanese get very interested and want to know what technology is being used to make KUBdoubleH. So they send a delegation to Tel Aviv to find out more. When they arrive, they meet the company’s President who gives them forecast sales figures followed by plates of delicious hot knaydlach soup made, of course, with KUBdoubleH. The Japanese delegation instantly decide to sign a contract which will allow them to manufacture KUBdoubleH in Tokyo.

And then they are taken to see the knaydlach production line in action. And as soon as they see it, they get a big surprise. There, working on a large conveyor belt making knaydlach, are hundreds of chimpanzees.

Arnold and Naomi are on holiday in London and go to see a very popular West End show called

AN EVENING OF MAGIC AND ILLUSIONS BY THE GREAT MINKOVSKY

Minkovsky has just amazed his audience by clearly sawing in half a volunteer from the audience and then putting him back together again. After the applause eventually dies down, Arnold shouts out to Minkovsky, "Oy mister. How on earth did you do that?"

"Well sir," replies Minkovsky. "Anyone can come to my dressing room after the performance is over and I can show them how I did it. But I would then have to kill them immediately afterwards."

After thinking about this answer for a few seconds, Arnold shouts back, "Ok, Mr Minkovsky, I agree with your terms and conditions. Please be ready to show my wife how it was done!"

### #1929 After the celebration

[My thanks to Asher P for the following]

Sidney asks his wife Sarah, "Is it OK to go out tonight for a few lechayim drinks with my friends Benjy and Harry to celebrate Harry’s birthday?"

Sarah replies, "OK, but only on condition that you don’t get shikker as you always do on Pesach, drinking Palwin wine!"

"But of course," replies Sidney.

Later that night, after a number of drinks, Sidney is becoming quite woozy and true to his promise, he says goodbye to his friends and leaves. By the time he returns home, Sidney is feeling quite randy and immediately goes upstairs to Sarah. But she is lying on her back fast asleep in bed with her mouth open. Sidney has an idea. He goes downstairs, takes two Aspirin tablets from the medicine box, brings them back upstairs, and drops them into Sarah’s open mouth. Immediately, Sarah begins coughing.

"Oy vay! What on earth are you doing to me?" shouts Sarah. "What did you just put in my mouth?"

"I’ve just given you two Aspirin as usual, darling," replies Sidney.

"But I don't have a headache, you meshugganah," Sarah shouts at him.

"That's all I wanted to hear," says Sidney smiling and he starts to undress.

### #1930 A visit by Sir Alan Sugar

As part of his regular charitable activities, Sir Alan Sugar is today visiting a residential care home in Golders Green. Although it will be the first time he’s been to this particular home, he always looks forward to such visits because he loves cheering up the elderly residents, and they in turn always enjoy seeing and talking to a well known Jewish TV celebrity.

But as soon as Sir Alan enters the residents lounge, gornisht. He is dismayed to discover that no one seems to know who he is. So he walks over to a lovely elderly lady, gives her one of his big smiles and says, "Hello, sweetheart, what’s your name?”

"Miriam," she replies.

"So, Miriam, do you know who I am?" asks Sir Alan.

Miriam looks up at him for a few seconds, then replies, "No, I don’t know who you are. But don’t worry dear. Just ask one of the care nurses, they will tell you who you are."

### #1931 Bravery

### #1932 The misunderstanding

One day, as Rebecca is walking down Golders Green Road, she first hears, then sees coming towards her a man pushing a smart pram with a screaming baby inside. And oy vey, what a noise the baby is making.

As the man gets closer to her, Rebecca hears him saying, "Don’t worry Joshua, it will be all right," and "Try not to scream Joshua, nothing will go wrong," and then "Please keep calm Joshua, everything is fine."

When the man reaches her, she says to him, "I really admire the way you are talking to your baby, mister. I’m a mother myself and I think you’re doing a marvellous job in trying to soothe your son Joshua."

"Thanks, but I think you’ve misunderstood the situation," replies the man. "My name is Joshua."

### #1933 Who’s a dumkop?

[My thanks to John T for the following]

Paul is doing some shopping in Waitrose Supermarket one Sunday afternoon when he meets Sam, his next door neighbour. Before Paul can open his mouth, Sam says, "Paul, I’m so glad I’ve met you."

"Why?" asks Paul.

"Because you live in a bungalow and I wanted to tell you to please draw your bedroom curtains first before you next make love to your Naomi."

"Why are you telling me all this?" asks Paul.

"Because while you were making love to your Naomi last night," replies Sam, "the whole street was watching and laughing."

"Oy, what dumkops I have as neighbours," Paul replies. "What yolds they are. The laughs on them because I was out of the country on business yesterday and I didn’t get home until this morning."

### #1934 Recognition

Hannah and Arnold have just moved house and in her first week in their new home, Hannah has been spending a lot of time looking out her window to see what their neighbours are like. One morning, she shouts over to Arnold, "Darling, come over here quickly."

Arnold puts down his paper and does what he’s told. As they look out the window, Hannah points and says, "Just look at that couple who live over the road to us."

"Yes dear, I see them," says Arnold. "So what’s so special you should call me over to look at them?"

"Well," replies Hannah, "they are obviously very devoted to one another because every time he leaves to go to work, he passionately kisses his wife goodbye on their doorstep, then walks away blowing kisses to her all the way down the road until he’s out of sight."

"That’s nice dear," says Arnold.

"So why don’t you do that?" she asks him.

Arnold replies, "I’d like to dear, but I hardly know her."

It’s Wednesday and today is the day that Naomi, Esther and Rebecca always meet for coffee in Brent Cross shopping centre.

"So how has your week been, girls?" asks Naomi.

"Oy! Have I had a week," replies Esther. "Last Friday, my daughter caught my son-in-law kissing the au pair and after a blazing row he walked out on her and their two children."

Rebecca replies, "Oy vey! If you two think that’s bad, then just hear this. My son left home last Thursday and left me a note. It said he was gay and was leaving to set up home with the married man who lives opposite us."

Then Naomi replies, "Oy vey iz mir! You two have heard nothing yet. On Monday, my daily cleaner told me she didn’t want to work for me any more."

### #1937 Flying with a difference

‘Minky Airlines’, a new airline, has just opened up for business. It’s different from all the other airlines in that it’s the only one offering totally nude flights. The flights are not only great for passengers who like thrills and a bit of excitement whilst flying, but they’re also good for the flight attendants - it makes it easier for them to spot the passengers who order kosher meals.

### #1938 Repeat business?

[My thanks to Howard K for the following]

Benny, a bachelor, wins some big money on the Lottery and decides to spend some of it on a trip to New York. He’s always wanted to see the Big Apple in style, so he’s booked a Business Class flight and a Suite in ‘The Minky Plaza’, one of the City’s up-and-coming luxury hotels.

As soon as he arrives at the hotel, he unpacks, then goes down to the hotel’s posh lounge. As he’s sitting there drinking his coffee and kvelling, an attractive young lady suddenly sits down next to him. She puts her hand on his arm, looks him in the eyes, smiles seductively and says, "Hi handsome. I’d like you to know that I’m selling."

Benny thinks for a few seconds and then, because he likes the look of her, replies, "So nu, is vat you’re selling very costly?"

"No," she replies. "I believe that what I’m selling is very keenly priced."

"Vell all right then," says Benny excitedly, "I’m buying it. Let’s go to my room and complete the transaction right away."

Benny spends a great night with her and in the morning she asks him for $700. Although this is more than Benny thought it would be, he pays her with a smile - after all, it’s only a small part of his Lottery winnings.

A week later, Benny returns to his London home. But in the months that follow, he suffers from a number of sexually transmitted infections, all of them embarrassing and all of them unbelievably painful. At one stage, he becomes very ill and nearly dies. If it wasn’t for the Lottery win, he wouldn’t have been able to afford the very expensive medical treatments that eventually get him back to good health again.

The following year, Bennie again spends a week at ‘The Minky Plaza.’ One night, as he’s drinking coffee in the lounge, he spots the lady who nearly killed him the year before. She also sees him and immediately goes over to him. "Hi," she says. "It’s nice to see you again. I thought I’d let you know that I’m still selling."

"Oy vey, it’s you again," says Bennie. "I didn’t think you’d have the chutzpah to come over to me. So vot are you selling this year? Cancer?"

### #1939 The three undesirables

For some time now, Miriam and her husband have been unable to reconcile their many differences. It soon reaches the point where she can no longer stand his behaviour and she sues him for divorce. He immediately walks out on her.

During the ensuing court proceedings, Miriam’s lawyer informs the judge, "Your Honour, my client’s husband is what we usually describe as a parekh. He has walked out on my client and refuses to pay anything to support her. In addition, he’s also a very undesirable person indeed."

"What do you mean by ‘undesirable’, Mr Gold?" asks the judge.

"Let me give you three examples, your Honour," replies the lawyer. "My client’s husband is a shikker, a gonif, and a grober."

"Mr Gold, please explain to the Court, in English, what these three terms mean," asks the judge.

"Well your Honour," replies the lawyer, "he drinks just like Lot, he sins just like Haman, and he swears and curses just like Balaam."

As soon as the judge hears this, he declares, "The divorce is granted. And let me point out that if ever the three despicable associates of the husband are brought in front of me, I will make every effort to see that they are severely punished."

### #1940 The mind reader

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Max and his wife Miriam are invited to a party. Miriam is not sure whether she wants to go but Max says, "Let’s accept, Miriam. I think you spend far too much time at home and the break will do you good." She agrees.

During the party, Miriam gets talking to a very interesting man. "So what do you do for a living?" she asks.

"I’m a psychologist," he replies.

Miriam is now very interested. "Would you mind if I asked you for your advice on something?" she asks.

"I don’t mind as long as it doesn’t require a lengthy response," he replies.

"OK," says Miriam, "Here’s my dilemma. What kind of toy do you think it best to buy a gorgeous little boy for his fourth birthday?"

"Can you tell me a bit more about this boy?" asks the psychologist.

"Well," replies Miriam," he’s very good with his hands and is very artistic for his age. He’s very quick witted and has lots of saychel. In fact he’s a very clever boychick – he’s got a yiddisher kop."

"Mazeltov," says the psychiatrist. "Now I understand. This little boy is your son."

### #1941 The stolen watch

[My thanks to Lynn’s brother-in-law for the following]

It’s Sunday and 12 year old Benny has just finished his barmitzvah class and is getting ready to go home. But he’s not feeling too good because earlier, during the mid morning break, he saw the rabbi’s gold watch on a desk and put it in his pocket while no one was looking. Now he’s very worried that he’ll be found out. In fact he’s so worried that he decides to go see the rabbi straight away, before he goes home.

"Hello Benny," says the rabbi, "and what can I do for you?"

"I want to own up about something, rabbi," replies Benny. "I stole a gold watch."

"Oy yoy yoy Benny," says the rabbi, looking very worried, "that’s really not a nice thing to have done. Such an act is strictly forbidden, as you very well know. You must give it back to its owner immediately."

"Do YOU want it, rabbi?" asks Benny.

"No Benny, I don’t want it," says the rabbi, "you must give it back to its owner, as I just told you."

"But rabbi," says Benny, "the owner doesn’t want it."

"Well in that case," says the rabbi, "you can keep it."

### #1942 Dr Zhivago

[My thanks to Leslie T for the following]

NOTE: This is supposedly a true story about ‘Dr Zhivago’, told when the film was first released in London with ticket prices for newly released films much higher than normal.

Betty and Sylvia, two middle-aged ladies, have just spent many hours together shopping in the West End. As they leave Selfridges, Betty says, "Sylvia, it’s 2pm and I could do with a nice rest. How about us going to see the new film Dr Zhivago? It’s only just opened here in London and they say it’s very good."

"Good idea, Betty," replies Sylvia.

So they walk round the corner to the cinema, go up to the box office and ask the ticket clerk, "How much are the tickets?"

"Tickets this week, ladies, are £20 each," replies the ticket clerk.

"How much did you say?" asks Sylvia, looking a bit shocked.

"£20 each, madam," comes the reply.

"So what is he, this doctor Zhivago - a specialist?" asks Sylvia.

### #1943 Who said so?

[My thanks to John T for the following]

Out of the blue and just before their midday snack, Hannah’s au pair goes over to her and asks for a pay increase. Hannah is quite shocked and very upset about this request. So she asks, "Why do you want a pay increase, Rosa? Don’t you think we give you enough already?"

"I’ve thought about this for a few days now, Senora," replies Rosa, "and I can give you three reasons why I think I deserve a pay rise."

"So what is the first reason, Rosa?" asks Hanna.

"I bentsh better than you do, Senora."

"Who said you bentsh better than me?" asks Hanna.

"Your husband said that, Senora," replies Rosa.

"Oh did he now?" says Hanna. "And what is the second reason?"

"I make chicken soup better than you do, Senora," replies Rosa.

"Rosa, that’s rubbish," says Hannah. "Who said you make better chicken soup than me?"

"Your husband said that, Senora," replies Rosa.

"Oh did he now?" says Hannah. "And what is the third reason?"

"I am a better lover than you are, Senora," replies Rosa.

"And I suppose my husband said that as well?" asks Hannah very angrily.

"Oh no, Senora," replies Rosa, "your brother-in-law said that."

"OK Rosa," says Hannah, "how much more money do you want?"

### #1944 Rock around the clock

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

It is very unusual to hear of a nice Jewish guy who enjoys working in a factory environment. But Daniel is just such a guy. For many years now, he’s been working for a seaside rock manufacturer in his home town of Brighton. But then one day he hands in his notice and applies for a similar job in Eastbourne.

At his interview, Daniel impresses his prospective new employer and so they decide to try and get some references from Daniel’s previous employer. Within 24 hours, the MD of the Eastbourne Rock Company telephones the MD of the Brighton Rock Company and says, "I’m calling to hopefully get some information on a previous employee of yours who has recently applied for a job with us."

"I’ll do what I can," replies the Brighton MD. "We rock makers must all stick together, excuse the pun, and help each other out. Who are we talking about?"

"That’s very kind of you," replies the Eastbourne MD. "I understand that a Mr Daniel Levy used to work for you."

"Yes, that’s correct," comes the reply.

The Eastbourne MD continues, "Mr Levy told us that he is a very hard worker who can make two miles of rock a day and that he has never taken a day off work, nor been late for work in 10 years. Mr Levy also told us that when a Foreman's job recently became vacant at your Brighton factory, he was totally overlooked for the role. And that he was so angry with you that he told you to (ahem) stuff the job and later that day walked out on you. Is all that correct?"

"Yes, it’s all true," replies the Brighton MD. "Daniel was a first class worker and he easily used to produce two miles of rock a day when asked to. He was an excellent timekeeper and I can’t think of any time when he took a day off sick. But in terms of the promotion he never got, we all here felt that his quick temper might cause us problems if he was ever promoted to Foreman."

The Eastbourne MD says, "Thanks for being so helpful. He sounds just like just the man we’re looking for."

The Brighton MD replies, "You're very welcome, but before you ring off, there’s something you can do to help me out."

"No problem. What is it?" replies the Eastbourne MD.

"If by chance," says the Brighton MD, "you come across someone in the trade who would like to buy two miles of seaside rock with the word, ‘SHMUCKS’ written through the middle of the rock, please let me know."

### #1945 The unknown soldier

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

A group of British MPs are visiting Israel for the first time and are taken by their host to see all the sights of this wonderful land. On the very last day, they visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But when they go over to the headstone, on it they read the following inscription: -

MOSHE GOLDMAN

HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND A GREAT FURRIER.

One of the MPs can’t really believe what is written on the headstone, so goes over to his host and says, "I don’t understand why this is the grave of an unknown soldier. Surely, if the person is known by name, how can he be an unknown soldier?"

"I understand your confusion," the host replies. "However, take my word for it that as a soldier, he really was unknown. But as a furrier, he was the greatest."

### #1946 The speed checker

[My thanks to Asher P for the following]

Howard is a technology maven. One day, as he is driving down Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, he passes a sign saying that he is approaching the most advanced road-side camera in the world. So he slows down to the 30mph speed limit. But when he passes the camera, it flashes at him.

"Not much of an advanced camera," he thinks. "I wonder what incorrect speed it has been set at?" So he turns around, drives back 300 yards, turns around and approaches the camera again, this time at 20mph. Again it flashes at him and he laughs out loud. Once again he turns around, drives back 300 yards, turns around again and approaches the camera again, this time at just 10mph. Once again, the camera flashes at him. He gives up on the faulty camera and drives home.

One week later, three letters drop through his letterbox. Each one is a Traffic Fine for £100 for driving without a seat belt!

[My thanks to Asher for the following]

One day, Moshe and Sydney meet at Brent Cross Shopping Centre. "So how’s life treating you Moshe?" asks Sydney.

"Mazeltov Moshe," says Sydney. "Did you get any nice presents?"

"Well," replies Moshe, "mine Sarah bought me an SUV."

"Wow!" says Sydney, "What a fantastic present to be given. I would love to have an SUV. It looks a great car to drive."

"Don’t get too excited," says Moshe. "Sarah only bought me Socks, Underwear and Viagra."

### #1951 Memories!

[My thanks to Asher P for the following]

Isaac Minky grew up and did all of his scientific training in his home town of Euston, London. After getting his BSc and PhD degrees, he leaves for Tel Aviv where he quickly becomes the world’s most renowned Metallurgist.

A few years later, Professor Minky is back in Euston to deliver a significant paper on metallurgy at a leading scientific conference. He walks up to the podium, places his papers on the lectern, and because his lecture is also being broadcast live on radio, carefully adjusts the microphone. Then he begins. But oy vey, as soon as he starts talking, he somehow manages to knock most of his papers onto the floor. But even worse, as he bends over to pick them up, he inadvertently lets loose an enormously loud fortz (don’t forget, he had his mother’s chopped liver, chicken soup, and salt beef with latkes and broccoli the night before). The microphone amplifies this ‘sound’ not only to all those in the conference hall, but also to all those listening to him on the radio. Although terribly embarrassed, he somehow maintains his composure and delivers his paper without further mishap. As soon as he finishes, he quickly leaves the theatre and is never seen in his home town of Euston again.

40 years later, Professor Minky gets a message that his elderly mother is very ill in a hospital in Euston. Even though he still clearly remembers what happened the last time he was in Euston, he decides that he must see his mother. So he books into a hotel under the name of Miller. When he arrives, the desk clerk says to him, "Welcome, Mr Miller. Is this the first time you’ve been to Euston?"

"No it isn't," replies Professor Minky. "I actually grew up here in Euston and received my education here, but then I moved overseas and I’ve not been back since."

"So why have you waited so long to return?" asks the desk clerk.

"Well I did visit once, many years ago," replies Professor Minky, "but a very embarrassing thing happened to me and since then I've been too ashamed to return."

The clerk tries to console him. "I realise that I’m only a clerk, Mr Miller, but I have learned that what at the time might seem embarrassing to us isn’t even remotely embarrassing to others. I bet that's also true of what happened to you and that everyone has forgotten it. When did it happen? Was it a long time ago?"

"Yes," replies Professor Minky, "it happened many, many years ago."

"So how long ago was it?" asks the clerk. "Was it before or after the Minky Fart?"

### #1952 Snap!

Renee and Isaac have been invited to Sarah’s wedding and are discussing what present they should give her.

"So what do you think, Isaac?" asks Renee. "I’ve known Sarah for many years but I can’t say she’s one of my very best friends."

"Well in that case," replies Isaac, "I don’t think we should give her anything too expensive."

"I agree, darling," says Renee, "so I have a suggestion to make. Do you know that ugly silver tray we were given on our wedding? We haven’t used it once and it’s still in its original box. I know it has our initials engraved on it, but I’m sure a good silversmith can remove them and put some new initials on it. Sarah won’t be able to tell it’s not a new tray and we’ll save some money."

"What a great idea," says Isaac. Why not take it in to Roken the silversmith tomorrow?"

So the following day, Renee takes the tray to Mr Roken and tells him how she would like the tray altered.

Mr Roken uses an eye glass to look closely at the existing initials, then looks up at Renee and says, "Oy yoy yoy, lady, it can’t be done - one can only make such changes three times."

### #1953 The thief

Hannah bumps into an old friend of hers at Brent Cross Shopping Centre. "So, Judith, how’s life been treating you?" asks Hannah.

"Well Hannah, if you must know," replies Judith, "my very best friend has run off with my husband. I haven’t seen him now for over a week."

"Oh Judith," says Hannah, "I’m so sorry to hear it. Who is this kurveh? Do I know her?"

"No, I’ve absolutely no idea who she is," replies Judith.

"But you just called her your best friend," says Hannah, looking puzzled."

"Listen Hannah, anyone who takes that shmendrick of a husband away from me will always be my very best friend."

### #1954 Advice from the rabbi

Ruth and Paul are soon to be married and go to see their rabbi about a problem they’re facing. "Hello Rabbi Levy," says Paul, as they enter the rabbi’s office.

"Ah, it’s the shul’s future newly weds!" says Rabbi Levy, warmly. "You’re getting married soon, aren’t you? How are your preparations going?"

"Well rabbi," replies Paul, "that’s really why we’re here. Although we’re going under the chuppah in only three months time, we’re already experiencing an almost overwhelming desire to have some sex right away. And our desire gets stronger with every passing day. Even so, we’ve somehow managed to avoid sex, but we feel we won’t be able to do so for much longer.  Please help us, rabbi. What can we do and still stay on the right side of Judaic law?"

"I’ll tell you what you can do," replies Rabbi Levy. “You can drink orange juice."

Ruth looks puzzled and asks the rabbi, "Orange juice, rabbi? Do we drink it before or after having sex?"

"Neither," replies the rabbi. "I mean instead of."

### #1956 A testing occasion

23 year-old Emma is very excited. Last night her boyfriend proposed to her and she is about to tell her parents the good news over breakfast. "Mum, Dad," she says excitedly, "You know Joshua, the new boyfriend of mine I met only a few weeks ago? Well, he wants to marry me and I think he’s just perfect for me. It was love at first sight."

"Mazeltov darling," shouts Fay, as she rushes over to Emma and gives her a big hug and kiss. "I’ve been waiting for such news for some time."

"Well I hope he can support you," Issy says to Emma. "What does this boy of yours actually do for a living?"

"He’s a chazan, dad," she replies.

"Well, that’s not good news," says Issy. "I’ve always said that no daughter of mine is going to marry a chazan. If you insist on marrying him, I won’t be there to see it."

Emma breaks down crying and begs her father to change his mind, but to no avail. Then Emma has an idea. She suggests that at least he should go see Joshua in action, especially as his shul is within walking distance. Reluctantly, Issy agrees.

The following shabbes, Issy keeps his promise and goes to Joshua’s shul to see him in action. Emma is waiting on the doorstep when he returns home and immediately asks, "Well dad, what did you think of him?"

Issy replies with a wide smile, "Mazeltov, my darling Emma, I think Joshua will make a good husband for you."

On hearing this, Emma cries with happiness. "Oh dad, I’m so, so happy. But tell me – why have you changed your mind?"

"I haven’t," replies Issy, "Joshua is no chazan."

### #1957 The long promise

Zaydeh Martin is celebrating his 100th birthday at his Care Home with his friends and family. Everybody is complimenting him on how well he looks for a man of his age. One of those present, Paul, a reporter for the Jewish Chronicle, goes over to Martin and says, "I must say Mr Levy that you look remarkably fit for someone your age. How did you manage to achieve such an athletic looking body?"

"Well, Paul," replies Martin, "I’ll let you in on my secret. It’s because I spent over 50 years of my life in the open air walking long distances."

"That’s an impressive fitness routine," says Paul. "What made you decide to spend so much time doing it?"

"Well it was not entirely my choice. You see, on the very day my late wife Betty and I got married, we made a promise that we kept throughout our 64 years of marriage."

"And what was that promise?" asks Paul.

"Well, replies Martin, "we promised each other that whenever we got into a serious argument, the one who was proved wrong should put on a coat, go outside and take a long walk."

Joseph reaches 60 and decides to see his doctor. "So what’s the matter with you this time Joseph?" asks doctor Levine.

I’m now 60, doctor, and I just don’t seem to be able to do all the things around the house that I used to do. "

"OK Joseph," says doctor Levine, "pop up on my examination table and I’ll see what I can find."

When the examination is over, Joseph says, "OK doctor, don’t be scared, I can take it. Just tell me in plain English - what’s wrong with me?"

"Do you really want to know, Joseph?" asks doctor Levine.

"Yes I do," replies Joseph.

"Well, in plain English," says doctor Levine, "you're just plain lazy."

"Okay," says Joseph, "now give me the medical term so that I can tell my wife Sarah."

### #1960 Sam Levene’s Tailor Shop

NASA are once again launching spaceships to the Moon. In the first such launch, a spaceman named Bill lands on the moon, puts on his space suit, leaves his spaceship, and begins to do some exploring. He’d gone no more than 200 metres from the spaceship when, to his total astonishment, he sees a shop called SAM LEVENE’S TAILOR SHOP.

He can’t believe it but nevertheless it’s there all right, so he decides to investigate. He shuffles over to the shop and enters. Immediately a well dressed gentleman walks over to him and says, "Shalom. I’m Sam Levene, the proprietor of this high class establishment. And who may I ask are you?"

"I’m a spaceman," replies Bill, "and I landed here on the moon no more than 45 minutes ago."

"Oy vey," says Sam Levene, hitting himself on his forehead with the palm of his hand. "A presser is what I asked for and look what they send me – a spaceman."

Q: Why did 80 year old Benny die seven days after the death of his wife Sarah?

A: Because Sarah wasn’t around to tell him which pills to take.

Moral: When you reach the age of 60, you’d better start organising your pills yourself, or else..

### #1962 In the beginning

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

One day, Joshua the scientist announces to his colleagues, "I don't think we need God anymore. Science has finally discovered how to create life out of nothing. We can now do what God did 'in the beginning'."

As everyone starts to shake Joshua’s hand, the voice of God is clearly heard.

"Oh, is that so, Joshua?" says God. "Please do tell me all about creating life."

"Blessed art thou O Lord," says Joshua. "I can take soil and form it into the likeness of You, and then breathe life into it creating man."

"Well Joshua, that's very interesting," says God. "Show me how it’s done."

So Joshua and his colleagues go outside. Joshua then bends down to the earth and starts to mould the soil.

"Oh no, Joshua," interrupts God, "please use your own soil."

### #1963 What a family

90 year old Lionel from Hendon dies and his family begin to make arrangements for his levoyah. But they quickly discover that Lionel’s regular rabbi is in Israel and won’t be back in time for his funeral. Fortunately, they manage to obtain the services of Rabbi Levy from nearby Golders Green who agrees to officiate.

At the funeral, after chanting the kaddish and the prayer, el molay rachamim, Rabbi Levy begins his eulogy. "We are all here today to mourn the passing of Lionel Silver, a dear father and friend, and a respected citizen."

But before he can continue, a voice from the back shouts out, "What utter nonsense, rabbi. What are you talking about? This man was a gonif and a momzer. He would cheat his own grandmother out of ten pence."

Rabbi Levy quickly decides to take another approach, "We are all here today to mourn the passing of Lionel Silver, a patron of the Hendon Synagogue and a dedicated biblical scholar."

Another voice from the back shouts out, "Are you meshugga, rabbi? This man hadn't been inside a shul since his barmitzvah!"

For the third time, Rabbi Silver restarts his eulogy, "We are all here today to mourn the passing of Lionel Silver, a loving and dedicated husband and father."

Then another voice is heard from the back. "Rabbi, you obviously didn't know Lionel as I did. Getray he wasn’t. He cheated on his loyal and lovely wife Sarah whenever he could and he never had any time to spend with his lovely children."

At this point, Rabbi Levy looks up from his notes and, from his heart, says, "Have not most of us as Jews suffered from the insults and prejudices of our neighbours? Why must we stoop to their level and speak ill of our own kind? I’m sure there must be someone here today who knew Lionel well and is prepared to say something nice about him."

After a long period of silence, another voice from the back shouts out, "Lionel’s brother was worse than he was!"

### #1964 Wrong one

[My thanks to Asher for the following]

Judith is very worried. She believes that her 16 year old daughter Talya is having sex and therefore might get pregnant.  So Judith goes to see doctor Myers.

Doctor Myers tells her that teenagers today are very headstrong and any attempt to stop Talya could easily result in rebellion. And such a mother-daughter rift is something to be avoided.

"Oy, doctor," says Judith, "so what can I do?"

"I have a suggestion to make," replies doctor Myers. "Put Talya on a birth control programme. But first of all talk to her, and then give her a packet of condoms."

So that evening, as Talya is getting ready to go out on her date, Judith tells her about the situation as she sees it and then hands a packet of condoms to her.

Talya instantly bursts out with laughter. "Oh mum, have you got it wrong," she says, hugging her. "You really don't have to worry about me getting pregnant. I'm dating Rivkah."

### #1967 Nathan (the best salesman in the world?)

[My thanks to Ron V for the following]

Sidney dies and because he had never been a member of any shul and because he had therefore never paid anything towards his funeral expenses, Leah, his widow, decides to go looking for a nice coffin for her Sydney. There are two local firms of funeral directors and she goes to both to check out their prices.

"Could you please tell me how much your coffins are?" she asks the first funeral director.

"£300," he replies.

She then goes to the second firm, and is pleasantly surprised when she discovers the funeral director there has a recognisable Jewish accent. His name is Nathan.

"How much are your coffins?" she asks Nathan.

"For you, lady, we have really nice ones starting from £800. The price will depend on the wood you choose, and what kind of brass fittings you want attached," Nathan replies.

"But," says Leah, "Smith and Sons around the corner only charge £300 for their coffins."

"Yes I know they do," Nathan replies. "They’re cheaper than ours because very little workmanship goes into them. You only have to do this (as Nathan says this, he moves his elbows sharply outwards) and the sides immediately break open."

### #1968 Why is this night different from other nights?

[My thanks to Ilan H for the following]

One day Becky, aged 92 meets Shlomo aged 90 at their shul’s bridge class. They enjoy each others company so much that they agree to meet again. After a few more meetings, they decide to get married (both their partners have long since passed away). On the first night of their honeymoon, Shlomo moves close to Becky and holds her hand. Still holding hands, they fall asleep. On their second honeymoon night, Shlomo again moves close to Becky and holds her hand. Soon they both fall asleep. On the third night, Shlomo once more moves close to Becky, but this time, as he reaches over to hold her hand, Becky pushes him away and says, "No, not tonight Shlomo. I’ve got a headache."

### #1969 Kosher goat cheese

[My thanks to Asher for the following]

Sidney is 80 years old and he and a number of other residents from the MINKY Jewish Care Home in Golders Green are travelling through Holland by coach. Today they are visiting a kosher goat cheese farm and a young guide is taking them around the factory where the cheese is being made. After emphasising the importance of adding vegetable rennet (no other kind of rennet is kosher) to help harden the cheese, he takes them outside to the farm and shows them the goats that produce the milk.

As he looks around, Sidney notices another group of goats grazing on a fenced in part of the hillside. "What are those goats over there?" he asks the guide.

"They are the older goats who can no longer produce milk," replies the guide. "We let them roam around in peace and quiet. So what does the UK do with its old goats?"

"We send them on coach tours," replies Sidney.

### #1970 What a reaction!

[My thanks to Hilary for the following alternative version to joke #980, 44th set of jokes]

Miriam and Harold have spent a lot of money on a makeover for their Golders Green home and today, Miriam is in Harrods’ Persian carpet department looking for a suitable sized rug for their renovated lounge.

Then she sees a pile of large rugs in a corner. They could be just the size she’s looking for, so she walks over to them. The colour of the fourth rug down catches her eye and she decides to move away the rugs on top of it so she can get a good look at it.

She bends down over the pile and attempts to pull away the rugs on top of it. But they are heavy and as she increases her effort, she suddenly, unavoidably, lets out a fortz

Miriam is so embarrassed. She turns around slowly to see whether anyone is near her and, Oy Vey, a salesman is standing right behind her. Before she can make any excuse, he says to her, "There’s no need to be embarrassed madam. That was nothing to what you will do when I tell you the price of these Persian rugs."

### #1971 The vacuum cleaner salesman

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Morris is a shmuck and everybody knows it. He just cannot do anything without things going wrong because he just never thinks through any course of action he carries out. But he is a good looking guy and one day the unimaginable happens – he bumps into Naomi (literally), she falls in love with him and they marry.

As soon as they return from their honeymoon, Naomi insists that Morris looks for a suitable job that he can do without causing too many problems. Within weeks, he’s been hired by Minky Vacuum Cleaners as a door to door salesman.

Although all goes reasonably well in his first few weeks in the job, Morris somehow feels that he can sell more cleaners if he has a gimmick. Then, one afternoon, as he’s walking up the drive of his next potential customer, he notices some fresh dog turds on the path. He immediately knows what his gimmick is going to be and decides to try it out right away. He picks up the dog turds, puts them into one of his vacuum cleaner bags, wipes his hands on another bag, then knocks on the door.

A little old lady opens the door and sees a well-dressed young man carrying a vacuum cleaner. "Hello," Morris says to her, "is it OK if I take a couple of minutes of your time to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners?"

"Go away," she says to him, "I haven’t any money."

But as she starts to close the door, Morris pushes it open again. "There’s no need to be hasty," he says to her, "at least not until you have had a chance to see my demonstration."

And before she can respond, Morris empties the dog turds onto her hallway carpet and says, "If this vacuum cleaner doesn’t remove every trace of these dog turds from your carpet, I will immediately eat whatever is left. Where’s the nearest power point?"

The little old lady steps back inside and replies, "My power points will do you no good because they don’t work. The Electricity Board cut off my electricity this morning because I couldn’t pay their bill. So let me now go get you a fork for your meal."

### #1972 Baby trouble

Arnold is doing very well at his job and gets promoted to Departmental Manager. As a result of his increased pay, he and his wife Leah decide to start their long awaited family. But many months pass and there’s no sign of Leah getting pregnant, so they decide to visit doctor Levy.

When they enter doctor Levy’s room at the surgery, Leah explains to him that they have been desperately trying to start a family but were having no success. When he hears this, doctor Levy decides to examine Leah right away. So he says to Leah, "Could you please remove all the garments from below your waist and I’ll give you a quick check-over."

But Leah refuses. She points to Arnold and says to doctor Levy, "What, with him in the room watching?"

"Aha," says doctor Levy. "Arnold, I think I know what the problem is."

### #1973 How to survive

Hendon Shul has quite a few married couples who have enjoyed lengthy marriages. So Rabbi Bloom organises a discussion at the shul on, ‘how to stay happily married for a long time’ and invites shul members who have been married for 30 years or more to talk about their marriages. One member who turns up is Cyril and he’s been married for almost 50 years. So Rabbi Bloom invites Cyril to give the audience an insight into how he’s been able to survive 50 years with the same woman.

Cyril stands up and says to the audience, "Well, it’s simple really. I treated my Hettie with respect, gave her whatever she asked for, and took all her flack with a smile on my face."

"Is that all you did?" asks Rabbi Bloom.

"No, not all," replies Cyril, "on special occasions, I sometimes took Hettie to far away places."

"So tell us, Cyril," asks Rabbi Bloom, "where did you take Hettie on the last special occasion?"

"I took Hettie to Beijing in China on our 40th wedding anniversary," replies Cyril.

"Wow!" says Rabbi Bloom, "If only all Jewish husbands could follow your example. But before you sit down, Cyril, can you tell us what you're planning to do on your 50th anniversary?"

Cyril replies, "I'm going to go back to Beijing and bring Hettie back."

### #1974 Table manners

[My thanks to Asher for the following]

Daniel is sitting at a table with some of his friends and family at his cousin’s barmitzvah party. They have just eaten a terrific meal of chicken soup, roast chicken, asparagus spears, broccoli (Daniel’s favourite), roast potatoes, rhubarb tart and lots more.

Now he is utterly bloated and glad to be sitting down. But then, Oy Vey, as the minutes tick by, he starts to feel the desperate urge to pass wind. He says to himself, "The music is really loud and I’m sure if I did have to, no one would hear me anyway."

Five minutes later, the urge becomes too great and he releases his pent up wind. And for the next few minutes, it was one fortz after another. "Thank God the music is loud," he says to himself. But when he then looks around the table at his friends and relatives, he sees that they are all staring at him. At once, Daniel understands why – he remembers he’s listening to his ipod.

As our treat to you, we want you to stay in bed and we’ll make breakfast."

Soon the smell of fried eggs and vorsht wafts up into her room and Betty is now really looking forward to her breakfast in bed. But after 15 minutes have gone by and there is still no breakfast, Betty gets up and goes downstairs to investigate. And there is Suzy and Paul sitting at the kitchen table finishing off their breakfast. And there’s nothing cooking. Betty looks at them both and says, "Nu? Vos iz mit the breakfast?"

"We’ve already told you," replies Suzy. "It’s our surprise for Mothers Day. We decided to make our own breakfast this morning."

### #1978 The unofficial Seder night invite

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

It’s the first Seder night and David and Andrea have invited their parents, their grandparents, their children, their grandchildren, their mishpocheh and many of their friends. The house is packed.

After the main prayers are over, it’s PARTAKE OF THE MEAL time, and while the food is being served, the front door bell rings. Uncle Max is nearest the door and so opens it. There on the doorstep is a man looking a bit forlorn.

The man says to Max, "I need someone’s help…."

But before he can continue, Max says, "Say no more. Anyone who is in need tonight can come in. Follow me and I’ll get you some food and a nice glass of wine to warm you.  Max then shows him into the dining room and although no one knows who he is, the latest guest is soon sitting down with the others and enjoying a great meal with Pesach wine.

45 minutes have gone by when suddenly the man gets up, goes over to David and Andrea and says, "Thank you both for the hospitality you’ve shown me. I wasn't even invited to this party – I only came in to tell you that one of your guests' cars is blocking the road and I can’t get my large 4x4 past it. Not only that, I’ve just remembered that all this time, my wife has been sitting in our car patiently waiting for me to get the other car moved so we can get home."

### #1979 Accuracy is everything!

[My thanks to Uriah for the following]

70 year old Bessie is brought into Edgware Hospital suffering from what looks like a bullet wound to the knee. She is seen by doctor Minky and operated on very soon after. Later, doctor Minky visits her and tells her that the operation was a success. "You’ll be pleased to learn that the bullet missed your knee and you should soon be back on your feet. So tell me, how did it happen? I have to fill in a police report for all suspected bullet wounds."

"Oy, doctor," cries Bessie, "it’s all my husband Bernie’s fault,"

"Why do you say that?" asks doctor Minky.

"Because I found out from a friend of mine that Bernie was going to leave me for a shiksa 30 years his junior," replies Bessie. "He told my friend that he was soon going to start a new life without me."

"So was it Bernie that shot you?" asks doctor Minky.

"Oh no, doctor," replies Bessie, "I just couldn’t bear to go through the shame of Bernie leaving me so I decided to shoot myself with the gun he keeps in his bureau for emergencies. I know where my heart is, so I aimed the gun just below my left nipple and fired. And that’s why I’m here."

### #1980 How To Sell Well

Benjamin applies for a job at HARRY’S GOLF EMPORIUM and during the interview tells Harry that he’s an experienced salesman. Harry agrees to give him a chance. Later that week, on Benjamin’s first day at work, Harry secretly observes how Benjamin is getting on. He quickly sees that Benjamin is in deep conversation with a distinguished looking gentleman.

"What’s the use of just one golf tee?" Benjamin says to the man. "A pack of 100 is only £5 and they’ll last you a long time. Is that OK?"

"All right," replies the man, "I’ll take 100."

"And if you’re planning to play a good round of golf," says Benjamin, "why play with old balls? I suggest you buy a dozen new balls for £10."

"I suppose so," says the man.

"OK, so now you’ve got new balls and new tees," continues Benjamin. "But surely you’re not going to use an old putter? We’ve got a great new putter that’s just arrived in stock. For just £100, your putting will instantly improve."

The man nods his head and says, "Add it to my list."

"But just having new balls and a new putter isn’t really going to increase your overall game," says Benjamin. "To do that you’ll need a new set of irons and we have just the set for you at £300."

"I’ll take the set," says the man.

"OK, let me recap," says Benjamin. "You’ve got new tees, new balls, a new putter and a new set of irons. What’s missing is something to carry them in. May I suggest a nice new solid leather golf bag. We have just the one for you, it’s our best seller and it’s only £400."

"Yes, I suppose I will need one," says the man.

"And then," continues Benjamin, "why should a man of your status lug around such a heavy load over 18 holes? Your shoulder will be killing you. We’ve got a great electric golf trolley for £600 which will take all the burden from you. Apart from the status it will bring, you’ll love its ease of use."

"All right, I’ll take it," says the man. "How much do I owe you in total?"

"One thousand four hundred and fifteen pounds," replies Benjamin.

The man writes out a cheque and gives it to Benjamin.

"Thank you," says Benjamin, "Do take a seat over there by the TV and I’ll get someone to bring you some coffee while I get your items ready for you."

Thirty minutes later, the man loads his car with his new golf items and drives off.

Harry has seen the entire transaction and immediately goes over to Benjamin, shakes his hand, and says, "Benjamin, that was brilliant! I’ve been running my Golf Emporium now for over 20 years and yours is by far the best piece of selling that I’ve ever encountered. And just to think that the man walked in for a golf tee and you sold him over £1,400 worth of equipment."

"What do you mean, he came in for a golf tee?" says Benjamin. "He came into the shop and asked me whether there was a chemist shop near here. So I asked him whether he was sick and he replied, "No, I’m not sick. My wife is having her period and I need to get her something." So I said to him, "As your wife is going to be sick for a few days, why don’t you take the opportunity to play some golf over the next few days?"

### #1981 Problems, problems

As doctor Ginsberg is taking his Sunday morning walk, he sees 80 year old Freda, one of his patients, on the other side of the road. And he can’t help noticing how slowly and painfully she is walking. So he crosses the road to find out what’s troubling her.

"Hello Freda," he says, "how are you feeling? You look like you’re in some pain."

She stares hard at doctor Ginsberg for a few moments, then replies, "Nu? You ask me how I'm feeling? So let me tell you already how I’m feeling. Everything hurts, that’s how I’m feeling, doktor. My heart is beating heavily in my chest, I find it hard to breathe if I walk too fast, both my knees are sore, my arms ache like hell, I’ve got a terrible headache, and on top of all that, I haven’t had a good pish for days."

"Oh dear, Freda, I’m sorry to hear this," says doctor Ginsberg. "But if you’ve been feeling so bad, why haven’t you come into my surgery so that I could check you out?"

"Doctor," says Freda, uttering a deep sigh, "I was just waiting until I felt a little better before I came to see you."

### #1982 The Speedy Diagnosis

[My thanks to Carol M for the following]

Soon after Simon becomes a doctor, he joins his local GP practice as a replacement for the elderly and soon-to-retire Dr Levy. At the end of his first day of work at the practice, Simon accompanies Dr Levy on his evening round so that the local Jewish community can quickly get to know him. The first patient they visit is Miriam, who has been in bed for much of the past week.

"So what’s the matter with you, Miriam?" asks Dr Levy.

"I’ve had bad diarrhoea for days, doctor," replies Miriam, "and I can’t seem to shake it off."

After just a few minutes of further discussion, Dr Levy suddenly says to Miriam, "I suspect you’ve been eating far too much fresh fruit.  May I suggest you give fruit a rest for a few days - I’m sure that will clear up the problem."

When they leave the house, Simon says to Dr Levy, "How did you manage to come up with your diagnosis so quickly? And why didn’t you examine her?"

"There was no need for an examination," replies Dr Levy. "Did you notice me dropping my stethoscope on the floor next to her bed?"

"Yes I did," replies Simon.

"It’s a strategy I’ve used before," says Dr Levy. "When I bend down to retrieve it, I look under the bed. In Miriam’s case, I saw apple cores, orange peel and banana skins, so I assumed that was the cause of her problem."

"Cool," says Simon, "I must remember that."

Then they arrive at the house of Dr Levy’s second patient.

"So Leah, what seems to be troubling you?" asks Dr Levy.

"Oy, doctor, am I weak! My energy levels are way down from normal."

After just a few minutes of further discussion, Simon suddenly says to Leah, "I suspect you’ve been spending too much time on shul work. May I suggest you cut back a bit - I’m sure that will clear up the problem."

When they leave the house, Dr Levy says to Simon, "I know Leah very well, and your diagnosis is probably spot on. But I’d love to know how you reached it so quickly."

"It was obvious," replies Simon. "I dropped my stethoscope on the floor next to her bed and as soon as I bent down to retrieve it, I saw the answer."

"So what did you see under the bed, Simon?" asks Dr Levy.

"The Rabbi," replies Simon.

### #1983 I’m in charge

Although Monty runs his own company, like many a groisser sheeser, he is, in reality, a groisser gornicht. So much so that in recent weeks, during his regular morning meetings, a growing number of his staff were openly disagreeing with his plans and some were even quite rude to him. The last straw was hearing someone say, quite derisively, "He thinks he’s the makher."

So next morning, he puts up a big shiny sign on the firm’s notice board. It reads: -

I AM THE BOSS

AND DON’T EVER FORGET IT!

Later that day, when he returns from lunch, he sees that someone has stuck a note under his sign. The note reads, "Your wife called. She said she wants her sign back ASAP!"

### #1984 What a coincidence!

[My thanks to Freda for the following]

Jacob and Judith are getting very worried about their teenage son David because he’s been behaving in a loutish and insensitive manner for some months. But when they tell him how they feel, David says things that shock them to their core. Next day, Jacob goes to see Rabbi Bloom.

"Rabbi," he says, "Judith and I are very worried about our boychik David. We’ve done everything possible to ensure that he grows up to be a nice Jewish boy. Not only did we give him a wonderful and very expensive barmitzvah, but we also spend many tens of thousands of pounds sending him to the best private Jewish school. But then yesterday, rabbi, out of the blue, he tells us that he wants to be a Christian. Oy vey rabbi, where did we go wrong? What can we do to change his mind? How can you help us?"

"What a coincidence!" replies Rabbi Bloom. "I too brought up mine son Hershel in the Jewish manner, and I too spent a fortune putting him through University. But then one day, just like your David, he informs me that he wants to be a Christian."

"You must be joking, rabbi," says Jacob.

"No I’m not," says Rabbi Bloom. "So I turned to Hashem for an answer."

"And what did God say?" asks Jacob.

"He said, 'What a coincidence! About 2,000 years ago, I too had a son......’"

### #1985 Isn’t love great?

Isaac has just returned home from work. He goes upstairs, gets changed into some casual clothes, then goes back downstairs into the lounge and sits down on his favourite armchair. He quickly starts to relax. Soon he hears his wife Ruth’s sweet voice talking to him from the kitchen. "What do you want for your dinner tonight, darling?" Ruth says. "Would you like some beef, some chicken or a piece of grilled salmon?"

Isaac shouts back, "I’d like the chicken tonight please, my darling."

Ruth shouts back, "I wasn’t asking you – I was asking the dog. You’ve got barley soup tonight."

### #1986 It’s elementary

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Noah looks around the Ark and is pleased to see that everywhere, the animals seem to be obeying God’s command and ‘going forth and multiplying.’

But then he notices with dismay that the adders are not doing what God has commanded. So Noah prays to God. "Blessed be art thou, O Lord," he prays. "The adder snakes refuse to go forth and multiply. What shall I do?"

God replies, "Please do not worry, my dear Noah. Cut up some trees and with the wood make four legs and an oval platform. Place the platform on top of the four legs and place the adders on top of the platform. This will verily solve the problem."

"But my Lord," says Noah, "how will this make the snakes obey your command?"

"Because," replies God, "even adders multiply when they have the use of a log table."

"Henry," he shouts, "where are you going that’s so important you should be running?"

"I’m going to a brothel," replies Henry.

"Nu? So why are you running there so fast at six in the morning?" asks Louis.

"Because I’ve got so many things to do today," replies Henry, "that I thought I’d better get this one out of the way as soon as I could."

"But how will you be able to do all of that?" asks Sadie. "You’ve got such bad varicose veins that you find even walking a challenge."

"Darling," replies Moshe, "You didn’t hear what I said. I said, '…in my next life'."

"Sorry," says Sadie, "I thought you said, '…with my next wife'."

### #1990 Only time will tell

Hendon shul’s elderly rabbi retires and is replaced by Rabbi Levy, a bright young rabbi who quickly turns out to be excellent in the performance of all his many duties except one - his sermons are always far too long.

One shabbes morning, as he is half-way through his usual interminable sermon, Rabbi Levy surprises the congregation when he suddenly stops, looks severely around at them, and says, "You know, I really don’t mind it when I see many of you regularly looking at your watches. But I think it’s going too far when you put your watches up to your ears to check if they are still working. Thank you. Good shabbes."

Aaron and his family are in the middle of their meal at Minky’s Kosher Restaurant when Aaron calls over the Manager. "I have a complaint to make," Aaron says. "I haven’t eaten here for quite some time, and I notice that the portions you’re now serving are a lot smaller than they used to be."

"That’s impossible sir," says the Manager. "You see, since you were last here, we’ve spent a lot of money enlarging the restaurant. So although the portion on your plate might appear to look smaller, it’s only an optical illusion."

If you walk down Hendon Street, you’ll notice two hairdressing salons very close to one another. One salon is owned by Cyril and the other by Monty. They have been bitter rivals for years. One morning, as Cyril opens up his shop, he notices that Monty has put a big sign in his window saying: -

WE’RE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO OFFER YOU A £12 HAIRCUT

Not to be outdone, Cyril puts up a sign in his window. His sign says: -

WE’RE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PUT RIGHT YOUR £12 HAIRCUT

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

One day, Adam is taking a walk with his sons Cain and Abel. As they pass the ruins of The Garden of Eden, Cain asks, "Father, what is that?"

### #1997 The Rabbi’s fan

[My thanks to Laurence F for the following]

As he’s been doing now for some months, Rabbi Bloom gives his weekly drasha to some inmates at a nearby prison. His aim, as always, is to encourage as many of them as possible to give up their life of crime. But as Rabbi Bloom is getting ready to leave, one of the warders goes over to him and says, "Rabbi, one of our inmates has asked whether he can have a few minutes with you privately in his cell. There’s no need to worry, he’s not dangerous, but I'll be outside the cell door just in case. Will you see him, Rabbi?"

"Of course I will," replies Rabbi Bloom.

As soon as Rabbi Bloom enters the cell, the prisoner says to him, "First of all, Rabbi, I’d like to thank you for the sermon - I thought it was good.  And thank you also for seeing me on my own. I didn’t want the other prisoners to hear me say to you that I’m becoming a great fan of yours and that I really admire your work."

"You do?" asks Rabbi Bloom.

"Yes Rabbi, I do," replies the prisoner. "In fact I have all your books, all your tapes, all your silver, all of …...."

### #1998 Here is a true story told to me by George B

My wife Marjorie and I went on a walk. When we got back to the Old Folks Home, I noticed the nameplate on the elevator. It said, ‘MADE BY SCHINDLER.’

So I said, "Look Marjorie, we’re on Schindler’s Lift."

### #1999 A woman’s views on the importance of exercise

My mother, God bless her, always looked after me and did everything she could, as a good Jewish mother, to help me live long and healthily. She took much naches in my upbringing. One of the things she taught me was the benefits of exercise, especially walking.  She told me that the main benefit to a woman of walking every day is that when she died, everyone would say, 'Kin-a-hora, doesn’t she look good!'

### #2000 Good news or what?

Jonathan has been working in New York for over a year when he rings his parents Judith and Isaac. He tells them that he’s returning to the UK for a few days because he has some good news for them. They are both naturally very excited and can’t wait to see him again.

The day finally arrives and as soon as he steps into his parents house, he says, "Mum, Dad, I’m engaged at last. I’m engaged to a fantastic girl."

"Mazeltov," they both shout out at once.

Jonathan then takes a photo from his wallet and passes it to his parents. "Look at this recent picture of us," he says. "Isn’t she just wonderful?"

Judith takes one look at the photo and asks, "But darling, isn’t she … just a bit … fat?"

"Well mum," replies Jonathan, "I know she’s not thin, but I wouldn’t really call her fat."

Isaac looks at the photo and then asks, "She’s very tall, son. Is she really head and shoulders above you?"

"Well dad," replies Jonathan, "I know she’s a bit tall, but you’ll soon get used to her."

"So, ….. is she Jewish?" asks Judith.

"Er … no, mum. I must be open and honest with you. No, she isn’t Jewish."

"Oh Jonathan," says Isaac, "isn’t there something you can tell us about your girl that’s positive?

"Yes dad, there is," replies Jonathan. "She’s a Baroness.”

"Oy veh iz meer," cries Judith, "she won’t even be able to have children."

### #2001 A move to the countryside

Avrahom and Leah are fed up living in a City centre apartment and decide to move out to the suburbs. They are able to buy a stunning 7 bedroom house with a 2 acre garden. Three weeks after the move, Avrahom meets his friend Howard on the train to work.

"So how’s life treating you out in the wilderness?" asks Howard with a smile.

"Azoy," replies Avrahom. "But don’t think it’s easy for us city folk to move to the suburbs. I personally found it very difficult and I was very depressed for the first few weeks. But I’m OK now."

"So how did you manage to get over your depression?" asks Howard.

"Simple. I got myself a paramour, that’s how," replies Avrahom.

"Oy veh," says Howard, "does ….  does Leah know?"

"Of course Leah knows," replies Avrahom.

"What?" says Howard. "You’ve got a paramour and Leah doesn’t care?"

"Of course not," says Avrahom. "Why should Leah care how I cut our lawn?"

### #2003 Communication problems

[My thanks to John T for the following]

Leah thinks that her Isaac is a bit of a shmuck. He never seems to take much interest in her - he’s always on the internet, or watching football, or listening to loud music. Educated he’s not. As a result she’s always berating him.

After one such argument, she somehow manages to persuade him to go with her on one of their shul’s courses, ‘MARRIAGE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION.’

During the course, the instructor says to the class, "One of the easiest things you can do to help improve communication is to know what your partner likes and dislikes. Let me see how much you know."

The instructor looks around the class and homes in on Isaac. "OK, Isaac," he says, "what’s the name of Leah’s favourite flower?"

Looking puzzled, Isaac whispers to Leah, "I’m sure it’s self-raising. Am I right?"

"Shmuck," she shouts at him.

### #2006 The laughing hyena

Note from David: Please excuse my translation at the end of this joke. If need be, tell me of my errors. Thanks

[My thanks to Annette for the following]

Paul is persuaded by his parents to takes Moshe, his elderly Russian born grandfather, to London Zoo because Moshe so loves animals. Whilst they are walking around the Zoo, Paul sees a notice announcing the Zoo’s free 30 minute lecture series.

"Look zaydeh," says Paul pointing at the notice, "there’s a lecture about to start on one of the animals here. I know you like animals so will you come with me? You’ll enjoy it."

"But what if I hear something I don’t understand?" replies Moshe.

"Don’t worry zaydeh," says Paul. "I’ll be sitting next to you and I’ll try to explain to you in Yiddish. I know you like me to practise my Yiddish."

When they arrive at the lecture theatre, it’s announced that, "the talk today is about the laughing hyena."

"A vus?" asks Moshe.

"A laughing hyena, zaydeh -- a khayeh vus lakht," replies Paul.

"Azoy," says Moshe, looking a bit puzzled.

The lecture turns out to be rather boring, but every now and then Moshe hears something that he doesn’t quite understand.

"The laughing hyena urinates once a week," says the lecturer.

"Vus, vus zogt eyer?" Moshe asks Paul.

"Di khayeh vus lakht pisht zikh oys ayn moohl a vokht," replies Paul.

"Azoy," says Moshe.

A little later on, the lecturer says, "The laughing hyena defecates once a month."

"Vus, vus zogt eyer?" Moshe asks Paul.

"Di khayeh vus lakht kahkt zikh oys ayn moohl a khoydesh," replies Paul.

"Azoy," says Moshe.

And a little later still, the lecturer says, "The laughing hyena has sexual relations once a year."

"Vus zogt eyer?" Moshe asks Paul.

"Eyer zogt az di khayeh vus lakht trent ayn moohl a yooer," replies Paul.

Moshe looks very puzzled by this reply and says to Paul, "Az di khayeh vus lakht pisht zikh oys ayn moohl a vokht, kakt zikh oys ayn moohl a khoydesh, und trent ayn moohl a yoeor ... far vus lakht er?"

### #2009 Oy, what good news I’ve heard

Kitty, Freda and Hannah are in Shalom Hospital’s maternity unit, each of them awaiting news of their own daughter’s impending birth. Soon, a nurse goes over to Kitty and says, "Mrs Levy, I have wonderful news for you. Your daughter has just given birth to twins. She’s fine and you’re now the bubbeh of two lovely healthy boys. Mazeltov!"

As Kitty gets up to leave, she turns to Freda and Hannah and says, "Oy, what good news I’ve just heard. My daughter Natalie has just given birth to twins. But what’s very strange about it is that my son-in-law works for the Twin Brothers fish restaurant."

Later, a nurse goes over to Freda and says, "Mazeltov to you Mrs Gold. Your daughter has just given birth to triplets. She’s fine and you’re now the bubbeh of three lovely healthy girls."

As Freda gets up to leave, she turns to Hannah and says, "Oy, what good news I’ve just heard. My daughter Suzy has just given birth to triplets. But what’s strange is that my son-in-law works for the Triple Valleys Water Company."

On hearing this, Hannah gets up and says, "Oy Veh! I’m going to leave with you."

"Why?" asks Freda.

"Because my son-in-law works for Seven-Up."

### #2011 Harry’s password

[My thanks to John T for the following]

The London branch of Bank Leumi decides to carry out an audit of passwords used by their customers. To their surprise, they find that Harry Levy, one of their elderly customers, has regularly been using a very lengthy password. The password being used was: -

AdamEveNoahMosesAbrahamIsaacJacobJosephJerusalem

So the office manager phones Harry. "Mr Levy," says the manager, "we’ve just discovered that you’re using an unnecessarily long password to get into your online account with us. Why did you choose such a long password?"

"I only did what I was instructed to do by your office," replies Harry.

"So what did they tell you to do?" asks the manager.

Harry replies, "They told me that the password had to be 8 characters long and had to include at least one capital."

### #2012 Ageing? Oy!

[My thanks to Jeremy H for the following]

David, Henry and Alan study law together at the Allen Law School and after qualifying, they each go to different firms of solicitors. They don’t see each other again for 25 years when out of the blue, David contacts the other two and sets up a reunion. The three are now approaching 50 years of age. After lengthy discussion, they finally decide to meet at Blooms Restaurant because not only are their wives unlikely to go there, but also the waitresses there are young, pretty and flirty. They enjoy themselves so much that they unanimously agree to meet again every ten years.

10 years go by and then, as agreed, David contacts the other two to arrange their reunion. The three are now approaching 60 years of age. After much discussion, they finally decide to meet at Bloom’s restaurant because not only do they serve great kosher food there, but also the wines are from Israel.

Another 10 years go by and then, as agreed, David contacts the other two to arrange their reunion. The three are now approaching 70 years of age. After discussion, they finally agree to meet at Bloom’s restaurant because it’s a quiet place where they can eat, talk about their grandchildren’s achievements, and tell Jewish jokes in peace.

Yet another 10 years go by and then, as agreed, David contacts the other two to arrange their reunion. The three are now approaching 80 years of age. After some discussion, they agree to meet at Bloom’s restaurant because the dining room is large enough to allow wheelchair access.

And yet another 10 years go by already and then, as agreed, David contacts the other two to arrange their reunion. The three are now approaching 90 years of age. After a short discussion, they agree to meet at Bloom’s restaurant because they have never been there before.

### #2013 The Chassidic wedding party

It's a Sunday evening and the guests at a Chassidic wedding have just sat down to eat. Then Robert, the young chozer bitshuva, having received instructions from his boss, the mashgiach, starts to go from table to table whispering to everyone, "the kolleh is a zonah."

Quickly, the mashgiach runs out to Robert and screams at him, "You fool, you weren't listening to me properly. I told you to tell everyone that the challah is mezonot."



chozer bitshuva: a once secular Jew who has become religious

mashgiach: a rabbi who supervises the food to make sure it is kosher

kolleh: bride

zonah: prostitute

the kolleh is a zona: the bride is a whore

challah: bread

mezonot: the blessing you make over certain food such as cakes

the challah is mezonot: the challah bread is in the bread/cake category (so that you can select the proper blessing before eating it)

### #2015 The convincing salesman

Hymie goes to ‘The Shmultzy Garage’ in Edgware to look for a second hand car and after spending 45 minutes with Daniel, the Garage’s most successful salesman, he buys a ‘highly recommended’ 4 year old Fiat.

Three days later, Hymie returns to the Garage and asks to speak with Daniel.

"Do you remember me Daniel?" asks Hymie. "I bought a Fiat Panda from you a few days ago."

"Of course I remember you," replies Daniel.

"And do you remember all the things you told me about the car?"

"Yes, of course I do," replies Daniel.

"Well then," continues Hymie, "could you please tell them to me again because I’m getting very discouraged with the car."

"That’s easy," replies Bernard. "It’s garlic."

"Garlic?" says the reporter. "Can you explain further?"

"Well," replies Bernard, "I eat a clove of garlic every morning after breakfast. Then, after lunch, I eat another garlic clove. And finally, just before I go to bed, I eat my third clove of garlic."

"Oy vay!" says the reporter. "And why do you think that works?"

"Well," says Bernard, "whenever the Angel of Death comes to me and calls out, ‘Bernard, Bernard,’ I turn and face him, take a deep breath, and loudly say, "Whooooooooooo?"

### #2019 From zero to five

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Daniel applies for and is successful in getting a job at Minky’s Delicatessen. But all does not go well for Daniel. Almost from day one onwards, he makes error after error - too many in fact for the company to ignore, and five weeks after joining, Daniel is called in to see the personnel director.

"Daniel," says the director, "I’ve had many complaints about you from staff working in the shop. They tell me you’re making the most elementary of errors. What upsets me most is that when you came in for your job interview, you told me that you had over five years experience of catering. But I’ve since done some checking and now discover that this is your very first job. What do you have to say about this?"

"Well," replies Daniel, "your advertisement specifically said that you were looking for someone with imagination."

### #2020 The theological argument

[My thanks to Lynn for the following]

Rabbi Gold, Rabbi Levy, Rabbi Warren and Rabbi Bloom meet in Golders Green, as they regularly do, for a good old theological argument. Unfortunately for Rabbi Bloom, at the end of their heated discussion the other rabbis vote "3 to 1" against him.

He always seems to be the loser and can't remember a time when their discussions didn't end up with his three colleagues voting against him.  He's very angry and for the first time, as they leave the building to go home, Rabbi Bloom decides to appeal to a higher authority.

"Blessed are you O Lord," he cries, looking upwards towards heaven with his arms raised up high. "Deep down in my heart, I just know that my argument today was absolutely correct and that my rabbi friends here were wrong. Please Lord, I beseech you, give us a sign to prove to them that I was right."

The sun had up to then been shining over Golders Green, but all of a sudden a large, dark and menacing cloud moves across the sun, there is a loud clap of thunder, and then as quickly as it arrived the cloud disappears and the sun is once more shining.

Rabbi Bloom looks at the other three rabbis and says, "There you are. I knew I was right all along. God has answered my question."

But the other three disagree with Rabbi Bloom's conclusion. Rabbi Gold points out, "It's not that unusual for an odd black cloud to appear on sunny days." Rabbi Levy says, "Nor is it rare for there to be a clap of thunder on sunny days." And Rabbi Warren says, "And what we have just witnessed can easily be explained by natural causes."

So once again, Rabbi Bloom prays to God. "O Lord," he cries, looking once more into the sky, "my rabbi friends here still don't believe me. Is it too much to ask that you give us a much greater sign, one that they can't argue with, to show them that they were wrong and I was right?"

The sun had up to then been shining over Golders Green, but suddenly many large, dark and menacing clouds move across the sun, and for the next 5 minutes there are flashes of lightening and loud claps of thunder. Then the sky goes pitch black and a booming voice shakes the very ground on which they are standing. The booming voice shouts, "RABBI BLOOM IS RIGHT."   Then as quickly as they arrived, the clouds disappear and the sun is once more shining. Rabbi Bloom immediately starts dancing up and down with joy. "I  told you I was right," he says with a large smile on his face. "So now what have you three got to say, eh?"

The three rabbis go into a huddle for a few minutes, then they go over to Rabbi Bloom and say to him, "OK, so now  it's 3 to 2 against you."

### #2021 The medical exam

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Rivkah, a very attractive and shapely 18 year old, is in the local surgery waiting to see doctor Myers. Her elderly bubbeh is with her. When Rivkah's name is called, they go into the doctor's office.

"And how can I help you today Rivkah?" asks doctor Myers.

"We've come in for an examination, doctor," she replies.

"OK Rivkah," says the now smiling doctor Myers, "could you please go behind the curtain over there, take off your clothes and lie down on the bed. Then I'll be over to examine you."

"Oh no doctor," says Rivkah, "you've got it wrong. It's not me that needs to be examined. It's my bubbeh here who does."

The smile on doctor Myers face dissolves as he says to the bubbeh, "Oh OK then. Please come over here, stick out your tongue and say ahhhh."

### #2022 How to increase sales

One day, Morris puts up a Notice in his delicatessen shop's window. It says: -

SPECIAL OFFER FOR LIMITED PERIOD ONLY

A SINGLE JAR OF HAIMISHE CUCUMBERS WILL COST YOU £1.20

BUT BUY OUR "METSIEH PACK" OF 3 JARS WHICH WILL COST YOU ONLY £4.80

Almost at once, customers started to come in to Morris to say something along the lines of, "Oy Morris, you think I'm a shmo? I should buy your three-pack for £4.80 when I can buy them separately for only £1.20 each? I'm not yet that meshugga.  So please wrap me up three separate jars of haimishe cucumbers."

Before his Notice went up, Morris hardly ever sold more than one jar of haimishe cucumbers at a time, but now he was doing a roaring trade in threes. That's what I call marketing!

### #2024 The rabbinical court hearing

Rebecca is suing her husband Stephen for divorce in a Rabbinical court and today she is being interviewed by Rabbi Levy.

"So Rebecca," asks Rabbi Levy, "what are the grounds for your divorce?"  "Well Rabbi," replies Rebecca, "Stephen and I have an up-market 7 bedroom house in Golders Green in about 2 acres of land, plus a swimming pool."

"That's not what I meant Rebecca," says Rabbi Levy, smiling. "Let me ask in another way. Briefly explain to me the foundations of your case."

"Our house is 100% brick and I believe it sits on a solid concrete base," replies Rebecca.

"No Rebecca," says Rabbi Levy, "that's not what I asked. Let me ask you a different question. Does your husband Stephen ever beat you up?"

"He certainly does, Rabbi," replies Rebecca. "He wakes up earlier than me two or three times a week."

Rabbi Levy is now beginning to sound quite frustrated. "So can you tell me what your current relations are like?" he asks.

"Well Rabbi," replies Rebecca, "my mum and dad love me a lot and are very helpful to me. I have one uncle who donates much to charity and another who has a great sense of humour - he writes Jewish jokes books, you know. But Stephen's parents don't seem to like me - they don't talk to me."

"That's not what I meant, Rebecca," says Rabbi Levy. "But let's move on. Do you have a grudge you would like to tell me about?"

"As it happens, Rabbi, I don't," replies Rebecca. "I've never really needed one - our carport is more than adequate."

"Oy vay," says Rabbi Levy, "this is proving harder than I thought. Look Rebecca, let me ask you an intimate question. To the best of your knowledge, has there been, at any time, any infidelity in your marriage?"

"I can answer that easily, Rabbi," replies Rebecca. "Yes, there has been and still is. Both my sons have their own stereo iPods and they play them loudly using loudspeakers all the time in our house."

At this, Rabbi Levy finally looses his cool. He looks straight at Rebecca and asks, "Rebecca, just why do you want a divorce?"

"I've never really wanted one, Rabbi," replies Rebecca, "but Stephen and I no longer have any contact with each other. Stephen has totally stopped talking to me - he hasn't spoken a word to me for over a year now and I think it's a chutzpah. The last words he said to me were, 'I've had enough.  I just can't communicate with you.'"

He tries very hard to get up from his chair. He pushes on his arms and soon he's straining,  grunting, groaning and shaking all over. Finally, after nearly a minute of effort, he rises from his chair, stops for a while to catch his breath and then starts shuffling along towards the door.

### #2028 The Rebbitsen's advice

After the shabbes service was over, Naomi goes over to the Rebbitsen and quietly says to her, "I feel terrible and I don't know what to do about it."

"So tell me Naomi, what has happened to make you feel this way?" asks the Rebbitsen.

"I've been cheating on my Henry, and I just can't face him any more," replies Naomi.

"So tell me more already," says the Rebbitsen.

"Well, on Thursday I made love to my next door neighbour twice, and yesterday I made love to him three times," replies Naomi.

The Rebbitsen remains silent for a little while she looks directly at Naomi, then says, "Here's what you must do. As soon as you return home, I want you to go into your kitchen and squeeze the juice of five lemons into a glass. Then you must drink the juice in one go."

"OK," says Naomi, "and will that enable me to face my Henry again?"

"I don't know about that," replies the Rebbitsen, "but it will at least wipe that stupid grin off your face!"

### #2029 A Bluffer’s Guide to the Shul Service

[The following article was written by NW Jew. For more of his writings, go to his blog at www.nwjew.wordpress.com.]



Worried about looking like a lemon in shul?

Finding the shul service impossible to follow?

Many people suffer from what is known in religious circles as “Mainstream Judaism”. No need to worry, however.  Our team of spiritual healers have devised a cure and we are making it available to you exclusively today.  Please pass it on to anyone you know who may be suffering in silence.



“Shul Rules” is your ten step guide to synagogue confidence:

1.    If you arrive after the start don’t sit down right away, but instead open the book near the beginning and spend 2 or 3 minutes turning slowly through the pages while mumbling under your breath.  If you recognise any of the Hebrew words, say one or two of them a little louder so those around you can hear.

2.    Find a seat just behind someone who looks like they know what’s going on.  (You can tell this person because they are likely to be mumbling to themselves under their breath).  Make sure this person is using the same prayer book as you.  Keep a note of what page they are on by glancing casually over their shoulder every now and again.  A pair of strong magnification glasses may help here.

3.    When putting on the tallit wrap it around your head for a few seconds while mumbling under your breath.

4.    Liberally sprinkle your time in shul with more barely audible mumbles as you look intently at the pages of your siddur.  Again, the odd word, phrase or line spoken accurately and a little louder than the rest goes down very well.

5.    Don’t jump up whenever the person in front does so.  They may be stretching their legs.  Instead, wait a moment until a significant proportion of the congregation are standing.  In this way, even if they are all stretching their legs you won’t look conspicuous.

6.    See those guys near the front that are wondering around with an air of assurance?  These are the shammosim.  AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE or you may find yourself being asked to do something strange like opening the doors of the Aron Kodesh or, heaven forbid, saying something in Hebrew out loud to everyone.

7.    The easiest way to look the part is to shockel.  I have met people who have won international shockelling competitions without having a clue about where in the service they were.  Advanced shockellers will even shockel when everyone else is sitting.  (Of course, sometimes this may be a disguised leg-stretch).

Schockelling is an entire lesson in itself but there are two basic forms.  The “lateral swing” is usually seen in ultra-orthodox congregations.  Here the practitioner is perfectly still from the waist down (feet together, naturally), while the top half of the body repeatedly twists at speed.

The “Hammerhead” is more prevalent in mainstream orthodox shuls and, as the name suggests, the congregant looks as if they are trying to bang a nail into the floor with his head.  (I say “his” because women prefer to use this time for kibitzing or kvelling over the way their grandson shockels.).

Shockelling mainly takes place during the silent Amidah.  This is about 10 pages during which you have no idea where everyone else is.  All you do know is that if the others were really reading all the prayers involved they would be contenders for the world speed-reading record.  You know when it starts because everyone takes three steps back, then three steps forward, then they bow.  This is your cue to start shockelling while turning the pages of your prayer book approximately every 15 seconds.  The end of the silent Amidah is signalled by everyone taking three short steps back, bowing to the left, the right and the centre and then looking round to see if they won.

8.    Is the Rabbi speaking in English and yet you can’t understand what he’s on about?  If so, this is the sermon and it’s your job to look alive.  Paying attention to the sermon is a skill that may take many years to master rather in the way that one learns how to complete cryptic crosswords.  The formula for this particular puzzle is fairly simple:  The narrative of Torah portion you have just heard plus something from local or national news equals “you should go to shul more regularly” or “your home isn’t kosher enough”.

9.    Feel free to talk to people near you at any time.  Business and football are particularly appropriate topics of conversation.  Seeking kavanah and listening to the sermon will be regarded with suspicion in most communities.

10.    If you can keep your cool until the end of the service you will be rewarded.  At last something that is familiar, and a chance to clear your throat and give it some as you bash out Ein Kelokaynu and Adon Olam just like you did at cheder all those years ago.



One final word of warning.  If it goes well and you feel confident enough to go back for a second week running you will be classified as a regular.  This means there is a very good chance you will be asked to be the next synagogue chairman.

### #2030 Chicken farming

Harry, a kosher butcher and poulterer, is in his lounge reading  the latest edition of Chicken Gazette. His wife Kitty is next to him doing her nails. Suddenly, a headline catches his eye:

COST OF REARING KOSHER CHICKENS FOR THE TABLE WILL SOON FALL DRAMATICALLY

He reads on.

'Israeli scientists have recently discovered that if you place rose coloured contact lenses over chickens' eyes, not only will they lay more and eat less, but also there is a reduction in henpecking.'

Harry can't help but read out the article to Hettie, adding, "Isn't that interesting darling? I bet you as soon as word of this discovery starts to circulate, a pair of rose coloured spectacles will be the most popular present husbands buy their wives."

NOTE: You'll be pleased to learn that Harry's facial bruising is at last beginning to fade.

### #2031 Landscaping the Hassidic way

[My thanks to Yonatan for the following, one of his humorous thoughts based on an actual event]

Whilst driving through Montreal on business, Lionel notices a group of men working on a very large front garden. The men and their equipment were all over the lawn and all over the flower beds. Outside the house was a large lorry with the words:

MINKY'S KOSHER LANDSCAPING COMPANY

Lionel drives over to see exactly what's going on and realises that all the workers are ultra orthodox frummers. All are wearing kippas, all have peyess, all their tzitzit are clearly visible and blowing in the wind, and all are wearing white shirts and black waistcoats. But Lionel is not too surprised to see such a scene as there are many hassidic businesses in that part of the city.

Then Lionel sees the gantzer makher, an elderly hassid who's instructing each member of the group as to where they must schlep their large and heavy looking wheel-barrows full of earth and flowers; how thickly they must shmear the earth on the flower bed; and where exactly they must plant each and every flower.

Looking at all the activities going on, a thought comes to Lionel. "They'll never be able to get much to grow in that front garden - the soil is too hassidic.



hassid, hassidic: member of ultra-orthodox sect

tzitzit: the fringes at the corner of a prayer shawl

peyess; side curls worn by ultra orthodox males

gantzer makher: big shot

frummers religious people

kippa: skullcap

schlep: to drag, carry, haul

shmear: spread

### #2032 Aging friends

Leah and Sarah meet in Brent Cross Shopping Centre. They are old friends and both have been married to their husbands for a long time.

"Nu, how are things with you Sarah?" asks Leah.

"Not too good really," Sarah replies. "I'm feeling quite low because I don't think Robert finds me attractive anymore."

"Why? How do you know this?" asks Leah.

"Because as I get older," replies Sarah, "he bothers less and less to look at me. When I was younger, he couldn't take his eyes off me."

"I feel so sorry for you," says Leah. "As I get older, my David says I get more and more beautiful each day."

"Yes," replies Sarah, "but don't forget David is an antique dealer!"

### #2033 The ovoid area excuse

[My thanks to Ron L for the following]

Brian is spending so long in the bathroom that his wife Carolyn bangs on the door. "Brian," she shouts, "what are you doing in there? Writing your memoirs?"

### #2035 The friendly test

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Rebecca is always finding something wrong with her Benny - whether it's his eating habits, his bad driving, his forgetfulness, his dirty shoes, his lack of attention, his ..... (you name it, he's doing it wrong). And her constant bickering is getting Benny down.

After the latest episode, Benny starts to believe that their dog Cindy is much more of a friend to him than is Rebecca and decides to test this out.

One cold morning, when Rebecca goes into the garden to put some rubbish in the dustbin, he pushes Cindy out the door to join her, locks the door, and goes upstairs for a lie down. When Rebecca realises that Benny has locked her out, she starts banging on the  door and shouting, but he ignores her. After thirty minutes of this, Benny goes back downstairs, unlocks the door and lets in Rebecca and Cindy.

Who do you think was the most happy to see Benny when they got back into the house?

### #2036 First time at an expensive restaurant

Isaac reaches 70 and to celebrate, he and his wife book a table at the Ritz, a really posh restaurant in the heart of London. As soon as they arrive, they are shown to their table by the immaculately dressed maitre d'. And what a table! A beautiful silk tablecloth; sparkling silver cutlery; the finest of bone china; stunning cut glass wine glasses; and a lead crystal vase containing the finest of freshly cut flowers.

As soon as they sit down, and before the maitre d' can intervene, Isaac removes the silk napkin from its solid silver napkin ring, unfolds it around his neck and ties a knot at the back.

The maitre d' looks aghast at Isaac and holding back his anger, says, "Will Sir be requiring a haircut or a shave tonight?"

### #2037 Bubbeh's wisdom

[Here is one of the oldest Jewish jokes I know. Maybe it’s worth repeating here for the many newcomers to Jewish humour]

A bubbeh is babysitting but her 8 year old grandson Paul doesn't want to go shluffen. So she decides to test him with a quiz question, a piece of hassidic wisdom that many bubbehs tell their grandchildren in these circumstances.

"Here's a nice quvestion for you," she says to Paul. "Vot is green, sits on a fence, und vistles?"

Straight away Paul replies, "I don't know bubbeh."

"Ahh bubbeleh," she replies, "zat's for you to guess."

Paul thinks for a while, then replies, "I give up, bubbeh. Please please tell me. What is green, sits on a fence and whistles?"

"A herring," replies bubbeh.

Paul is puzzled. "But bubbeh ...."

"Yes bubbeleh?"

"But a herring isn't green," says Paul.

"Nu? So you paint it green," says bubbeh smiling.

There is silence while Paul thinks this one out.

"OK bubbeh," says Paul, "but a herring doesn't sit on a fence."

"Nu? So you put it on a fence," says bubbeh.

There is more silence while Paul grapples with this new response.

"But bubbeh ...." says Paul, looking even more puzzled.

"Yes bubbeleh?"

"But a herring doesn't whistle," says Paul.

"Ach. So vat if it doesn't vistle?" replies bubbeh with a shrug of her shoulders. "Who cares? Now go to bed bubbeleh."

### #2038 Rachel's strategy

65 year old Rachel goes to MINKYS WINE BAR. She is on the lookout for her fourth husband. As she is waiting to be served, she notices an elderly well dressed handsome man standing at the bar. So she goes over to him and introduces herself.

"Hi," she says, "My name is Rachel. I saw you were alone and thought you could do with some company. And as I just love bald-headed men, here I am."

"But I'm not bald, at least not yet," says the man. "So far I've still got some of my hair, as you can see."

"Oh don't worry about that," replies Rachel, "I'm very patient. I can wait."

### #2039 The poker playing dog

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

Paul is passionate about poker. Every Thursday, he spends at least five hours at his shul's poker club and it's the highlight of his week.  But then his enjoyment is shattered when his elderly mother has a serious fall and is now unable to take her precious dog for his daily walk. So she pleads with Paul to take the dog on his walk every day until she recovers. Even though this is a great imposition and will mean missing his poker day for a couple of months, how can Paul refuse his Jewish mother?

After a couple of weeks of walking the dog, Paul is desperately missing his poker. So he thinks to himself, "I'm sure the dog won’t miss just one of his walks each week, so why don't I take him to the shul

The first Thursday Paul takes the dog to his shul, it becomes clear that the dog is keenly interested in the game. So Paul  sits the dog down on his table and lets him watch what is going on.

One Thursday, many weeks later, Paul is sitting next to Alex, a features writer for the Jewish Chronicle. Alex looks up as the cards are being dealt and sees the dog on the next table. Alex nudges Paul and says, "I can't believe what I'm seeing, Paul. Look over there. There’s a dog playing poker."

"Yes, I know," says Paul. "That’s my mum’s dog. I realise it's very unusual to see a dog playing cards, but he just loves poker."

"Oy," says Alex. "This could be a scoop for me. Tell me about your mum's dog. Is he a good poker player?"

"No," replies Paul, "he's absolutely useless at playing poker."

"Why do you say this?" asks Alex.

"Well Alex," replies Paul, "every time he gets a good hand, he just can't help wagging his tail."

### #2040 The recital

One day, as chazan Isaacs is walking down Edgware High Street humming Adon Alom out loud, he hears someone calling his name. He looks around and sees shuffling towards him a poorly dressed man whom he doesn't recognize. So he continues with his walk and his humming. But he soon hears his name being called again.

"Chazan Isaacs, chazan Isaacs, please stop," shouts the man. "My name is Aaron and I've something important to tell you."

So chazan Isaacs stops and lets Aaron catch up with him. "How do you know who I am?" he asks Aaron.

"Because I attended your shul recently and I heard your chanting," replies Aaron. "I enjoyed it very much."

"It's nice of you to tell me this," says chazan Isaacs, "but surely that's not reason enough to stop me here in the street."

"No, I stopped you to say that your house is on fire," replies Aaron.

"And how do you know it's my house?" asks chazan Isaacs.

"Do you live at number 1 Edgware Street?" asks Aaron.

"Yes, that's my house all right," replies chazan Isaacs, looking a bit worried.

"Well then, let me tell you again," says Aaron. "Your house is on fire, chazan."

On hearing this, chazan Isaacs opens his jacket, takes out his tuning fork, and with a flourish taps it on a nearby brick wall. Then he puts it to his ear and sings out loudly, "Oyyyyyyyyyyyyy Gevaaaaaaaaaaalt."



chazan: cantor, the singer who leads synagogue services

adon alom: a well known shul melody

oy gevalt: exclamation to denote fear, terror, astonishment.

### #2043 Bubbehs and Zaydehs

[author unknown]

•    Spending one hour with your grandchildren makes you feel young again. But spending any longer makes you age quickly

•    Your grandchildren are such a metsieh. For example, if you let them play with your loose coins for an hour, they'll give you back £1million worth of naches in return

•    When bubbehs and zaydehs enter the room, discipline flies out the window

•    Grandchildren are God's way of compensating us for growing old

•    Bubbehs never run out of hugs, biscuits, cakes or sweets

•    Although bubbehs and zaydehs only hold our little hands for a short time, they hold onto our hearts for ever

naches: pride and pleasure from the achievements of one's children / grandchildren

Avrahom has done very well in his business. He now lives in Hampstead Garden Suburb and drives around in a top-of-the-range Bentley. As a result, he has seen an increase in the number of friends who stay around him as often as possible. One of them is Harry.

"Harry," says Avrahom one day, "you're always with me. I would have thought you'd be bored with me by now."

"But I like being close to you, Avrahom," replies Harry.

"So nu? Why is that?" asks Avrahom.

"Well," replies Harry, "let's just call it, 'gelt by association'."

He then looks out the window and says to Lionel, "Aren't we lucky to be having such a beautiful day?"

"What do you mean by 'we'?" snaps Lionel. "All of a sudden you're a Partner already?"

### #2046 Chicken, chickens and yet more chickens

A small community just outside of north west London advertises for a rabbi and following several interviews, Rabbi Green and his wife move into their new home near the shul. And because Rabbi Green's pay is not great, the rebbitsen decides to raise chickens to create some additional income. She is a very determined lady and follows all the tips and advice she can get hold of for raising the healthiest, cleanest, and most fertile chickens. And the rebbitsen succeeds! Two years from start up, the rebbitsen's chickens are known throughout  north west London for their size and quality.

One day, the rebbitsen realises that she has many more chickens than she can sell. Tsedaka immediately comes to mind and after a quick discussion with Rabbi Green, she starts to makes arrangements to hand out their surplus chickens to members of their shul.

Next day, the following notice appears on the shul's notice board: -

WILL ALL THOSE WISHING TO RECEIVE A FREE CHICKEN FROM THE REBBITSEN, PLEASE CONTACT HER. HER COOP RUNNETH OVER.



rebittsen: rabbi's wife

tsedaka: charity, the giving of something or a piece of your time to help someone else, without expecting anything in return. It is one of the cornerstones of the Jewish religion.

### #2047 It's a hard life

Jonathan and Maurice meet one day in Hendon. They hadn't seen each other since their University days.

"So Jonathan," says Maurice, "tell me about yourself."

"I'm married, I've a beautiful wife, three gorgeous children, and if I say so myself, I'm a successful businessman," replies Jonathan. "How about you?"

"I'm quite the opposite to you," replies Maurice. "I'm only living to fulfil my mum's opinion of me."

"What do you mean by that?" asks Jonathan.

"Well," replies Maurice, "despite my mum's incessant nagging, I'm still not married. And in terms of a career, I own a local coffee bar."

"So what's wrong with that?" asks Jonathan.

"To my mum, I'm the nebekh," replies Maurice sadly. "My older brother David is the successful architect, my younger brother Paul is the successful accountant, but me, well I'm the nebekh. And after her most recent rejection, I'm beginning to believe her."

"Why, what happened?" asks Jonathan.

"Mum told me many years ago that she'll only be proud of me when she sees a bank statement showing I have accumulated £100,000," replies Maurice. "Fortunately, my coffee bar has been doing great business for quite some time now and I was at last able to go to mum with a smile on my face and a bank book showing £100,000."

"So what did she say to you when she saw it?" asks Jonathan.

"She said, 'You call that money?'"



nebekh: a nothing, a nobody

### #2048 The helper's surprise

One day, when Leah gets back home from work, she is astonished to find her husband Benny at home. "Benny, what are you doing home so early?" she asks.

"I decided to take the afternoon off for a change," he replies.

"And where is our babysitter?" asks Leah.

"I paid her and told her that we didn't need her this afternoon," Benny replies.

"Why did you do that?" asks Leah. "The supper needs to be prepared and cooked; the children need bathing, the laundry needs washing and ironing, the ......"

"Oh don't worry about all that, darling," interrupts Benny with a smile. "Come let me show you."

Benny takes her hand and leads her into the kitchen. She immediately notices that the oven is on and the table neatly laid for four. She can smell roast chicken. She also notices that the laundry has not only been washed but also neatly ironed and carefully folded. Benny then takes her upstairs where she finds the children playing with their toys.

"Hello mummy," they say, "Daddy has bathed us, dried us, and made us put on our pyjamas. He's even helped us with our homework. Isn't that nice of him?"

"Yes darlings," replies Leah, "that was very, very nice of daddy."

When they return downstairs, Leah asks, "So to what do I owe the honour?"

Benny replies, "I read in the papers this morning that wives who work full time and who also have to do their own housework when they return home, are nearly always too tired to have great sex. So I thought I would help you today."

"Oh thank you darling," she says and gives him a warm and tender kiss.

Later, they have their dinner (served by Benny). Afterwards, he clears the table, washes and dries the plates and cutlery, and puts it all away. He then takes the children upstairs, puts them in their beds and reads them a bedtime story.

When Leah goes into work next day, she just has to tell her lady friends what had happened. They were amazed. One of them asks her, "So Leah, so what happened next after the children were asleep? I bet you had a real sexy night, eh?"

"I wish I could say yes," replies Leah, "but Benny was so tired, he fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillows."

70 year old Cyril makes an appointment to see his doctor.

"So how can I help you?" asks doctor Levy.

"I was speaking to my pharmacist yesterday and he suggested I should ask you to change my prescription," replies Cyril. "And he also suggests that you check the prescription you've given to Miss Jones."

"That's a bit of a chutzpah, don't you think, Cyril?" says doctor Levy. "Since when does a pharmacist query a qualified doctor's diagnosis?"

"Since he discovered that I've been on birth control pills for the last two months." replies Cyril.

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Hymie has asked for a divorce and is now appearing before a judge. The judge looks at Hymie and says, "So tell me in your own words, Mr Franks, why are you seeking a divorce?"

"I'm seeking a divorce, your Honour, because I feel I can no longer survive living in a 2-story house," replies Hymie.

The judge smiles and says, "I've never heard such a spiel before in a divorce court. What kind of reason is that to ask for a divorce and waste this Court's time? What's so special about a 2-story house?"

"Let me explain," replies Hymie. "In my house, one story I regularly hear is, 'No you can't! It's that time of month' and the other story I regularly hear is, 'No you can't! I have a headache'."

"I'm from the funeral parlour, Mrs Bennett. I wish you long life. I'm so sorry to disturb you at such a sad time but I have to make arrangements for your late husbands burial. I understand your husband was a reform Jew, but unfortunately, I've not been told whether you require your husband to be cremated, embalmed, or buried in the normal way."

### #2054 Five ways to pray

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

A priest, a minister, a guru and a rabbi meet to discuss the best positions for praying.

"I find kneeling is definitely the best way to pray," says the priest.

"Well I get good results by standing with my hands outstretched to Heaven," says the minister.

"I firmly believe that the most effective prayer position is lying down on the floor," says the guru.

"I disagree," says the rabbi. "I get the best results by shokeling."

A telephone engineer who is working close by hears this conversation going on and can't help joining in the discussion. "You're all wrong," he says. "The best praying I ever did was when I was hanging upside down from a telephone pole."



shokeling: from the Yiddish word meaning "to shake" is the ritual swaying of Jewish worshippers during prayer, usually forward and back but also from side to side. Also written as shuckling

"Well that should be OK then," says Netanyahu, "for here in Israel, we read from right to left."

### #2057 The anniversary present trip

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

Next week will be Diane and Daniel's 30th wedding anniversary and Daniel desperately wants to celebrate the occasion with a special gift. But throughout his marriage he's made poor decisions on choosing gifts for Diane. So he decides to ask his rabbi for advice.

Rabbi Bloom is very helpful. "There are," he says, "many things that men see that they think a woman will like. But it's a fact that there will be many other things that women will like much better. It's been like this since the beginning of time. So my advice to you is this - take Diane to Central London for the day. Take note of the shops she stops at and what catches her eye. You'll then know what to do."

So the following weekend, Daniel cancels his regular golf and says to Diane, "Darling, may I suggest we go on a trip to Central London. We haven't been there for some time."

Diane immediately agrees.

As they wander around, they arrive at Hatton Garden and Daniel notices that Diane's pace has slowed to a crawl, finally grinding to a halt outside MINKY'S THE JEWELLERS. Diane starts to breathe heavily.

"Is there something inside you'd like look at?" he asks.

"Yes, yes" she whispers.

Within minutes, Diane has a diamond earring on her ear and an assistant holding up a mirror to help Diane see how good the diamond looks. Seeing the look of rapture on Diane's face, Daniel quietly goes over to the manager and asks, "It's our wedding anniversary. So how much is the diamond that my wife seems to love?"

"Before I answer that," says the manager, "I would like to wish you a double mazeltov."

"Why double?" asks Daniel.

"Because," replies the manager, "not only is it your anniversary, but also you have a wife with exquisite taste. Such a wife is so rare to find nowadays. Many women have no appreciation of quality."

"OK," says Daniel, "You can cut out the shmooze. How much?"

"The diamond on your wife's ear will cost you £2,000," replies the manager.

Daniel nearly faints. "£2,000 .... oy veh, that's .... that's an arm and a leg..." he says.

The manager then walks over to Daniel and pats Daniel's left shoulder. Then he pats his right shoulder followed by his left thigh and lastly his right thigh. Then he says to Daniel, "I've just checked you over and it seems that God has given you two good arms and two good legs to celebrate your anniversary. Can I assume that you will be taking a matching pair?"

### #2059 An early morning reading

It's 8am and Arnold is about to leave for work. But as he always does, he first of all opens his morning mail. One of the letters is an invoice from his doctor and he is not happy with what he reads. So Arnold goes into the kitchen and says to his wife Estelle, "Darling. I've just received the invoice for my annual medical check-up and you won't believe me when I tell you how much Dr Kraskoff has charged me. What a chutzpah!"

"So tell me already," says Estelle.

"£600. That's what he's charged me. £600. And what makes me doubly angry is that Dr Kraskoff's invoices are so clear and un-ambiguous. Quite different from his prescriptions which are always so very difficult to read."

"Don't be a shmo Sharon," replies Jeremy. "Supposing you drown and your body can't be recovered?"

### #2061 The interpreter

A Court hearing is taking place and the next witness to be called up is eighty year old Hymie. He has a long beard and payess, a kippa on his head and he's wearing his tzitzits outside his trousers.

The judge takes a quick look at Hymie and decides it unlikely that this witness is going to be able to freely converse in the Queen's English. So the Court's Jewish interpreter is immediately summoned.

The judge then says to Hymie, "There's no need to be concerned about giving evidence in English to this Court. We have an experienced Jewish interpreter with us to help you. I hope this meets with your approval."

"Thank you your Honour," replies Hymie in beautifully clear English, "but I don't need an interpreter. I was Professor of English at Cambridge University for 40 years and ....."

At this point, the interpreter interrupts and says, "Your Honor, ehr hat gesagt........."



payess; side curls worn by ultra orthodox males

kippa: skullcap, see also yarmulka

tzitzits; fringes or tassles found on the corner of a prayer shawl worn by observant Jews

### #2062 The rabbi's great sermons

As Leah and Isaac are walking back home after the shabbes service, Leah says, "Do you know darling, I think Rabbi Bloom today made one of the best sermons I've heard for years. He's really inspired me."

"I agree with you there, Leah," says Isaac. "He's very good. In fact, I think he would really appreciate someone saying something positive about him for a change. So as you like his sermons so much, why don't you shmooze him a bit next shabbes and tell him how much you enjoy his sermons?"

"I might just do that," says Leah.

Next shabbes, as soon as the service finishes, Leah goes over to Rabbi Bloom. "Good shabbes rabbi," she says. "I want to tell you just how much I enjoy all your sermons. They're wonderful works of inspiration. They're so good, in fact, that I think you should have them published. What an inspirational book that would be."

"Why thank you Leah," says Rabbi Bloom. "I'm very flattered. But there are many rabbis whose sermons are much, much better than mine are."

"I cannot believe that, rabbi," says Leah.

"Well if they're really as good as you think," says Rabbi Bloom thinking aloud, "maybe my sermons should be published posthumously."

"Great!" says Leah. "What a good idea, rabbi. I just can't wait to get hold of a copy of your book."



shmooze: talk idly or casually and in a friendly way

### #2064 The shul quiz night

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Cyril asks his friend Mervyn, "So how did the shul quiz go last night?"

"Oy Cyril, I was hoping you wouldn't ask," replies Mervyn.

"Why?" asks Cyril.

"Because in the middle of the quiz, I was asked to leave the shul. I can't tell you how embarrassing that was."

"What happened?" asks Cyril.

"When I was asked the question, 'Where do the most women have curly hair?', I gave what I thought was the correct answer, one that any man might have given. But it was the wrong answer and I was told to leave the shul at once. How was I to know the correct answer was 'Africa'?"

### #2065 On his way up

As Lionel is walking past a house in Golders Green, he hears the voice of a woman shouting loudly and almost instantly knows she must be a Jewish mother. This is what he hears:

"Philip, you're not listening to me. You're much too young to be climbing a loft ladder. I want you to get off it right now."

Silence.

"Did you hear me Philip? I said climb down at once. If you don't, you'll fall and you'll hurt yourself."

More silence.

"OK, Philip. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you fall off the ladder and break both your legs, don't come running to me."

### #2066 What a year!

Sarah meets her friend Suzy in Brent Cross shopping centre. They haven't seen each other for years.

"So nu? How are you Suzy?" asks Sarah. "How's everything going with you?"

"Oy veh, you shouldn't ask," replies Suzy. "It's been a terrible year for me so far."

"Why, what's happened?" asks Sarah.

"Nine months ago," replies Suzy, "my son Gerald suddenly decides to leave his wife Rivkah and his two daughters and go live with a man. Six months ago, my lovely daughter Sharon crashes her car and has to have her right hand amputated. Then three months ago, my husband Monty  has a massive heart attack whilst we're making love and dies before any help can arrive. And tomorrow, the decorators are coming."

### #2067 The new tallis

Emanuel is a very strict and religious orthodox Jew. And because he's not that wealthy, he's been wearing the same tallis in shul for many years. In that time, not surprisingly, it becomes very shabby looking.

But then, one shabbes, Emanuel arrives in shul and surprises everyone by putting on a lovely bright, new tallis. At the end of the service, the rabbi goes over to Emanuel and asks, "So Manny, tell me. Where did you get such a lovely new tallis?"

"I got it as a Christmas present from my son-in-law," replies Emanuel.

### #2068 It's nothing new

Aaron, in his final year at University, is having a chat with his zaydeh.

"So tell me already, Aaron," asks zaydeh, "what is this course you are taking?"

"I'm taking psychology, zaydeh," replies Aaron.

"Nu, so what exactly is a psychology?" asks zaydeh.

"Psychology is quite a new subject really," replies Aaron, "and that's why you didn't learn anything about it when you were at school. Briefly, psychologists try to understand men and women's brain functions and also their behaviours, such as perception, attention, emotion, motivation, personality, and interpersonal relationships. They do this so that they can better understand how someone acts; why he says what he says; and why he does what he does."

"Oy, now I understand," says zaydeh. "And you think this is something new? Why, when I was a young boy growing up, my parents called it yiddishe saychel."



yiddishe saychel; Jewish common sense

zaydeh: grandfather

[My thanks to Joe D for the following]



I once wanted to become an atheist but I gave up.  They have no holidays.

[Mel Brooks]



Even if you're Catholic, if you live in New York you're Jewish. If you live in Butte, Montana, you're going to be a goy even if you are Jewish.

[Lenny Bruce]



God, I know we are your chosen people, but couldn't you choose somebody else for a change?

[Shalom Aleichem]



The remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served us nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.

[Calvin Trillin]



Let me tell you the one thing I have against Moses. He took us forty years into the desert in order to bring us to the one place in the Middle East that has no oil.

[Golda Meir]



Even a secret agent can't lie to a Jewish mother.

[Peter Malkin]



My idea of an agreeable person is a person who agrees with me.

Don't be humble; you're not that great.

### #2070 Park bench chat

[My thanks to Dalia for the following]

One day, as young Arnold is walking in the park with his friends, he comes across a white-haired old man sitting on a park bench reading a book.

Arnold loves books, so he goes over to the old man and asks, "What are you reading, mister?"

"A history book," replies the old man.

Arnold quickly looks at the book's cover and can't help noticing that it's called, MAKING LOVE THE SHMUTZY WAY. Feeling a bit embarrassed, Arnold says to the old man, "But it's a book about ...... about sex, isn't it?"

"Oy, you're right there, son," replies the old man looking rather sad. "But it's also a history book because unfortunately for me, sex is history."

### #2071 The new arrivals

Nathan sees his wife Sarah looking attentively out of their bedroom window. "What are you staring at, Sarah?" he asks.

"Oh, I'm watching our new neighbours," she replies.

"What's so interesting in them?" Nathan asks.

"Well for one thing," Sarah replies, "it's lovely to see a married couple so devoted to each other."

"And how did you come to that conclusion?" asks Nathan.

"I've noticed that every time he leaves his house to go to work," replies Sarah, "he first of all kisses the mezuzah and then he passionately kisses her whilst gently squeezing her toches with both hands. And as he walks away, he keeps on turning around to blow her big kisses."

"Nu?  So what?" asks Nathan sarcastically.

"Well I was thinking, Nathan, why don't you do all that?" replies Sarah.

"Give me time will you?" Nathan replies, "I hardly know her. She's only just moved in."

### #2072 The teacher's request

"All right children," says the teacher, "please put your hand up if you know of some things that begin with the letter T."

After a short pause, Sean puts up his hand.

"OK, Sean, what things do you know of?" asks the teacher.

"Television, Turtle and Teacher," replies Sean.

"Good, Sean," says the teacher. "And what about you Ali? What things do you know of?"

"Table, Tiger and Tandoori chicken, Miss," replies Ali.

"Very good, Ali," says the teacher. "Who else can name things beginning with the letter T?"

Avrahom puts up his hand.

"Yes, Avrahom, what things do you know of?"

"Tzitzits, Tefillin, Tallis, Talmud, Torah and Toches, Miss," he replies.

### #2073 Calculating women

Ruth is telling her plump friend Miriam about her new exercise regime. "I go walking for 20 minutes every day, come rain or come shine, and it doesn't cost me anything."

"So why do you want all this aggravation?" asks Miriam. "To look better?"

"No," replies Ruth. "I read in the papers that for someone like me, a 50 year old woman, walking regularly will literally add minutes to my life each time I go out. I've calculated that I can add a further 6 months to my life by the time I reach 80."

"Phooey," says Miriam. "You've got a loch in kop. I don't want to put the mockers on your plans, but what's so beneficial these days in adding 6 months to one's life? I've just calculated that adding 6 months to the life of an 80 year old woman who's in a nursing home at £3,500 a month will cost her a further £21,000 plus expenses."

### #2074 Is this high quality or not?

Bernie buys his girlfriend Suzie a ring for her birthday and asks the salesman to put it in a nice box. Later that day, Bernie goes over to Suzie's house, wishes her a happy birthday, kisses her, and gives her the box.

"So go on Suzie," he says excitedly, "open the box, open the box."

Suzie opens the box and is dismayed to see inside a very tiny diamond mounted on a very thin gold ring.

"Oy gevalt! What a shmatta of a present," she says to herself.

Bernie can see that she's not very excited with her present, so he says to her, "I know it looks very small, Suzie, but I promise you the diamond is a very pure one. It hasn't got any flaws in it at all."

"I can believe that," says Suzie. "There's no room inside such a diamond for any flaws!"

### #2075 Please try to concentrate

Issy is in his lounge reading the Jewish Chronicle when his wife Hetty returns home. She goes straight into the lounge and says to him, "Issy?"

As usual there is no reply from Issy, or any other form of recognition that his wife has returned.

"Issy, are you listening to me?" she asks loudly.

Issy mumbles something incoherent and continues to read the JC.

"Issy, put the paper down for once and listen to me," she says. "I have to tell you something."

Issy lowers the JC a few inches, but still does not look directly at Hetty.

"Issy," she says, "I went to see doctor Levy this afternoon."

"So how is he?" asks Issy.

### #2076 Who's a know-all?

A mother knows absolutely everything about her children as they grow up - their favourite foods, their friends, their romances, the clothes they like wearing, their hopes and ambitions; their school reports, their dreams, their doctor and dentist appointments, and even what they're scared of most.

A father is aware (but only vaguely) that there are some short people staying in the house with him.

### #2078 The two talking parachutists

[My thanks to Geoffrey for the following translation of an original Salcia Landmann joke]

Moshe and Jake have been conscripted into the Israeli parachute regiment. As they prepare for their first jump, the instructor explains that it's very simple.  "You jump from the aircraft, count to twenty, and press the button on the left hand side of your pack.  The parachute then opens.  If it should fail to open, count again to twenty and press the button on the right hand side of your pack. The reserve chute will certainly open.  When you land, a car will be waiting to take you back to base."

Moshe and Jake jump, count to twenty and press the buttons on the left hand side of their packs. Their chutes fail to open.

They count again to twenty and press the buttons on the right hand side of their packs.  The reserves fail to open.

Moshe then shouts over to Jake; "You'll see, when we land there won't even be a car waiting for us."

### #2079 I've always wanted to say this

One morning, David notices that his beloved cuckoo clock is making a funny noise and is not keeping the correct time. So he picks up the clock and drives over to NATHAN'S WATCH AND CLOCK REPAIR SHOP.  All of David's friends tell him that not only is Nathan one of the best, but he's also Jewish.

As soon as David steps foot inside the shop, Nathan starts to shuffle slowly towards him and it's obvious that Nathan is a very old man. When he gets there, Nathan asks, in a very heavy German accent, "So vat sims to bee ze problem?"

"My cuckoo clock isn't working properly," David replies. "It's always been going TICK TOCK, TICK TOCK, TICK TOCK. But today, all of a sudden, it's been going TICK, TICK, TICK."

On hearing this, Nathan smiles and says to himself, "I've waited over 50 years to be asked to fix such a clock, and now here it is. I can now tell the clock what I've been wanting to tell such a clock for ages."

Nathan goes behind his counter, opens a drawer and takes out a large torch. He then takes the cuckoo clock from David, shines the torch directly onto the face of the clock and shouts, "Vee haff vays ov making you tock."

### #2080 The three kosher parrots

Benjy is in MOSHE'S KOSHER PETS to find a suitable pet parrot. As he's walking around, he sees a group of three parrots in a large cage. So he calls over Moshe, points to the blue parrot and asks, "How much is that parrot?"

Moshe replies, "That lovely parrot is £350."

"Oy," says Benjy. "Why is it so expensive?"

"I've priced the blue parrot at £350 because it has learnt the whole of the Tanach off by heart," replies Moshe.

And to prove it, Moshe goes over to the cage and recites the first few words of Deuteronomy Chapter 1 Verse 6, "The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb saying."

As soon as he stops, the blue parrot immediately continues with, "Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount."

Although impressed with the blue parrot, it was too expensive, so Benjy points to the yellow and green parrot and asks, "And how much is this parrot?"

Moshe replies, "That parrot is £800."

"Oy veh," says Benjy. "It's even more expensive than the blue one. Why?"

Moshe replies, "Because the yellow and green parrot knows and can discuss the whole of the Talmud."

And to prove it, Moshe goes over to the cage and asks, "Nashim is one of the six orders of the Mishnah. What are the components of Nashim?"

And the yellow and green parrot immediately replies, "Yevamot, Ketubot, Nedarim, Nazir, Sotah, Gittin, and Kiddushin."

Although very impressed with the yellow and green parrot, it too was far too expensive. So Benjy points to the red parrot and hoping it was affordable asks, "And how much is the red parrot?"

Moshe replies, "That parrot is £2,000."

"Oy vey iz meer," says Benjy. "What on earth can this parrot do that's so special to make it excessively expensive?"

"Well," replies Moshe, "I've not yet been able to discover what his talent is, but what I do know is that the other two parrots call him Rabbi."

### #2081 Diminishing returns

Moshe goes to see his doctor and returns home to his wife ashen-faced. “What’s wrong, Moshe?” Sadie asks.

“Doctor Myers has just told me I’ve only 24 hours to live,” he replies.

“Oy veh,” says Sadie. What are we going to do?”

“Well given the prognosis," replies Moshe, "I would like to make love to you now.”

Naturally, Sadie agrees and so they make love.

6 hours later Moshe goes to Sadie and says, "Darling, you know I now have only 18 hours to live. Could we please do it one more time?"

Sadie agrees, of course, and they do it again.

Evening comes and as Moshe gets into bed, he looks at his watch and realizes that he now has only 8 hours left. He touches Sadie’s shoulder and asks, "Darling, please... just one more time before I die?"

"Of course, darling," she replies wearily and they make love for the third time.

After this session, Sadie rolls over and soon falls to sleep. Moshe, however, worries about his impending end and tosses and turns until he's down to 4 more hours. He shakes Sadie awake and says, "Darling, I have only 4 more hours. Do you think we could..."

At this point Sadie sits up and says, "Listen Moshe, please leave me alone. I have to get up early in the morning to arrange a levoyah ... you don't."



levoyah: funeral

### #2082 Mistaken identity

60 year old Sadie still feels sexually active but the same certainly can't be said for her husband Bernie. So after many months of nil activity, she says to him, "Bernie, since we are no longer lovers, from now onwards I want you to call me Mrs Goldman. OK?"

"Yes dear," he replies wearily. "If that's what you want."

"It is," she says.

A few weeks later, whilst Sadie is reading in bed and Bernie is asleep next to her, he fidgets a bit and accidentally jabs her in her back with his bony knee. "Quick Bernie, quick," she shouts at him, "Call me Sadie and I'll turn over for you."

### #2083 Hymie the vet

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following joke]

There is a small Kentucky town that owns just one cow. It's an important cow because it provides much of the town with their daily milk. But when the cow dies suddenly, the mayor meets the townsfolk and tells them, "I know a cattle dealer from just across the State line in Illinois who's willing to sell us a replacement cow for only $300. What do you think?" The townsfolk immediately vote in favour. And what a fantastic purchase this turns out to be because from day one onwards, the cow starts to produce an abundance of milk.

Six months later, the townsfolk buy a bull to mate with their cow. They aim to breed a few more 'productive' cows just like the one they have and never again have to worry about 'milk supply' problems. But things don't work out as planned because every time the bull tries to mount the cow, the cow quickly moves away. This goes on non-stop for two weeks and so the mayor calls in Hymie The Vet to help solve their problem.

"Hymie," says the mayor, "no matter how the bull tries to mount the cow, whether he approaches her from the left, or from the right, or from behind, he just can't 'get his way' with her. She just always moves away. What do you think is happening?"

"Your story is a very interesting one," replies Hymie, "but I think I have an explanation. I've come across this type of behaviour many times before. Did you buy your cow from Illinois?"

The mayor is amazed. He never thought their cow's birthplace had anything to do with her behaviour. "Yes, it's true," replies the mayor, "our cow did come from Illinois. How did you know?"

With a vacant look in his eye, Hymie replies, "Because my wife originates from Illinois."

### #2084 The speedy bubbeh

Freda is over 90 years old and lives in Tel Aviv. And she still drives her car to the local shops and to shul every week. But then one day she is caught speeding. When asked by the police officer why she was speeding, she replies, "I'm very sorry for going so fast, officer, but I'm getting a poor memory already."

"So what has your memory got to do with your speeding?" asks the officer.

"Because I was trying to get to the shops before I forgot where I was going," replies Freda.

NOTE: The police officer thought this was such an original and funny excuse that he let her off with just a warning.

### #2085 Redecoration problems

[My thanks to Cliff L for the following joke]

Sharon is very proud of her husband Lawrence. For the first time in his working life, he's been promoted. He is now Office Supervisor of his company. So with the salary increase he has just been awarded, she decides to have their bedroom redecorated.

She goes to John Lewis, her favourite Department Store, and starts looking through their wallpaper catalogue. But oy, there are so many colours and so many styles that within half an hour she is thoroughly tsedrayt.

The department manager, seeing that Sharon might need some help, goes over to her and says, "Madam, maybe you need to consider a border."

"A border? No thank you," says Sharon. "My husband has just been promoted to a Supervisor and I am definitely not needing to take in a border."

### #2086 Foot problems

Morris, a bit of a dumkop if truth be known, is a single guy and spends 10 hours a day, 6 days a week standing behind his market stall selling books. And after 3 years of doing this without any time off, he starts to suffer from very painful feet. So he goes to doctor Myers for help.

"Your problem," says doctor Myers, "is caused by all the standing you do. I strongly suggest that you go to Miami as soon as possible for a holiday. And whilst there, you must regularly soak both your feet in the Ocean water. If you do this for a week, your feet will definitely recover."

Morris takes doctor Myers' advice seriously. As soon as he arrives at his Miami hotel, he buys 2 large plastic buckets, one for each foot. Then, first thing the next morning, with his buckets in his hands, he heads for the sandy beach.

Once there, he goes over to a lifeguard, points to the ocean and asks, "How much do you charge for two buckets of that Ocean water?"

The lifeguard can't believe what he has just heard, so replies, "Our current rate is $2 per bucket."

Morris pays the money, fills his buckets with Ocean water, returns to his hotel room and soaks his feet for an hour and a half. It was so lovely that he decides to do it again. After lunch, he empties his buckets and once again takes them to the beach. He goes over to the lifeguard, hands over $4 and says, "Same again please."

"Thank you," says the lifeguard, just managing to hold back his laughter, "just help yourself."

But when Morris turns around, he can't help noticing that the tide is out. So he says to the lifeguard, "Oy, have you got a good business here! You've sold out already."

### #2087 The mind reader

Ruth looks down over her balcony and sees her son Mervyn playing football on the lawn.

"Mervyn," she shouts down at him, "Mervyn, please come inside at once."

"No Mervyn, you're not cold," replies Ruth, "you want to eat."

But during their ride, a fox runs across Daniel's path and he takes a nasty fall. He is not only bleeding from the head but he also thinks he has badly injured his right leg.

Louis looks at Daniel for a while and then asks, "So Daniel, how much are your injuries hurting? Would you like to talk to me about the way you feel?"

### #2089 All abroad

Shlomo is attending a job interview. After he has filled in the application form, he's taken in to see the HR Manager.

"Good morning Shlomo," says the HR Manager. "Thank you for filling in our application form. Please give me a few minutes to go through it and then I'll ask you some questions."

Two minutes later, the HR Manager looks up and says to Shlomo, "OK, I've got a good picture of your qualifications. But I'm confused about two answers you've given. In section 4, you state that you have no relatives living abroad, yet in section 8 you state that you have a sister in Israel. How can that be?"

"Well it's true that I have a sister living in Israel," replies Shlomo, "but she's not the one living abroad, I am."

### #2090 A new perspective

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

A great rosh yeshiva is sitting at a wedding reception with his wife (yes, his wife) next to him. When the dessert arrives, his eyes open wide and he smiles. He then takes a huge slice of cake, then another, then....

His wife looks at him and says, "You really shouldn't be having that."

And he replies, "That's it! From now onwards, separate seating at simchas!"



rosh yeshiva: Title given to the president of a Talmudical academy (yeshiva). It is made up of the Hebrew words rosh (head) and yeshiva (a school of religious Jewish education.)  The rosh yeshiva is required to have a vast and penetrating knowledge of the Talmud and the ability to achieve a level of mastery of his material and an ability to analyse and present new perspectives, called chidushim (novellae), verbally and often in print.

When I've finished with you, you'll be another man entirely."

"I'm pleased to hear that, Adrian" says Hymie. "So don't forget to send your invoice to this other man."

### #2092 Overly ambitious

Jeremy is a hard working young man (but a khochem he's not) and always tries his best in everything he does. He has just passed his London bus driver's test and is given a bus route around the streets of Paddington.

At the end of his first day, Jeremy goes over to the depot manager and hands over takings of £55. At the end of his second day, Jeremy hands over takings of £65 and at the end of his third day, Jeremy hands over takings of £42. But then, at the end of his fourth day, Jeremy hands over takings of £375. His depot manager is astounded.

"Well done Jeremy," says the depot manager. "This is by far the highest amount we've ever taken on the Paddington route. So what happened today to bring in so much money?"

"On my first three days," replies Jeremy, "I was picking up only a small number of local passengers from the minor roads and backstreets around Paddington. But I was convinced I could do better. I knew Paddington was not too far from the West End of London, so this morning I drove my bus over to Oxford Street and Bond Street and worked there instead. And oy, what gold mines those two streets are!"

### #2093 The life saver

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Renee has recently gone through a messy divorce and is now beginning to unwind a bit. So she arranges to meet her friend Esther for coffee.

Esther asks, "So, Renee, what are you going to do with your life now that Robert has left it?"

"You might not believe this, Esther," replies Renee, "but I want to learn how to save someone's life. I want to put something back into the community. So last month I enrolled on a CPR course."

"Mazeltov," says Esther, looking a bit farmisht. " ....... but what exactly is CPR?"

"Suppose someone near you suffers a cardiac arrest or collapses with a choking fit," replies Renee. "You might be able to save their life by giving them cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, or CPR for short, until the ambulance arrives."

"Oy, this CPR sounds very complicated," says Esther. "I bet it's difficult to learn."

"Well I've only been to two classes, but so far it seems quite easy," replies Renee. "And next week certainly won't be a problem for me."

"Why not?" asks Esther.

"Because we're going to be taught how to breath life into a dummy," replies Renee, "and that's something I had been doing regularly for over 12 years."

### #2094  The weighing machine

[My thanks to Laurence F for the following]

Mervyn and his wife Sarah are waiting for their train at St Pancras Station when Mervyn notices a new weighing machine nearby. "I'm going to weigh myself," he says to Sarah. They both walk over to the machine.

Before Mervyn stands on the machine, he reads the instructions. He then turns to Sarah and says, "It seems that weighing machines are becoming more technical. This one will print out a card giving me not only my weight, but also an honest description of my personality."

"So weigh yourself already," says Sarah.

Mervyn gets on the machine and puts in a £1 coin. Immediately a printed card is issued. Mervyn takes the card and reads it.

"Well come on, what does it say?" asks Sarah.

"It says that I'm a very loving, considerate, helpful, and generous man. Here, read it for yourself," replies Mervyn, passing the card to Sarah.

Sarah reads the card and says, "This machine is an utter waste of time. It's got your weight completely wrong as well."

### #2095 The restaurant mascot

[My thanks to Diane M for the following]

One day, Nathan sits down at a table in "Minky's Kosher Restaurant." He's never eaten there before but has such a fantastic meal that he decides he will always eat there. Being a friendly and generous person, he quickly becomes the restaurant's favourite customer. Victor the manager even reserves a special table for him and every day over the next ten years, Nathan could be seen eating there.

But then business at Minky's begins to fall off and Victor decides to do some marketing - he puts a notice in the window:

COME IN TO MINKY'S AND EAT WITH NATHAN

IF OUR FOOD IS GOOD FOR HIM, IT MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU TOO

Business immediately picks up. All is going well again. But then one day, oy veh, Nathan doesn't turn up and Victor begins to worry. When Nathan doesn't turn up the next day either, Victor tries to phones him, but gets no reply. Victor phones not only the local hospital but also Nathan's daughter in Israel. But no-one knows where Nathan might be.

When Nathan doesn't turn up at the restaurant for the third day in a row, Victor panics. He's just about to call the police when he looks out his window and sees Nathan on the other side of the road going into "Rokeys Kosher Restaurant." Victor immediately leaves his restaurant, crosses the road and goes into Rokeys. He spots Nathan at a corner table, goes over to him, and angrily asks, "What's the meaning of this Nathan? Where have you been the last three nights? We've all been worried sick about you. Couldn't you have phoned or something?  After all we've done for you. And what on earth are you doing in here of all places? Didn't I tell you that Rokey and I are bitter sworn enemies? What have you got to say for yourself?"

"Calm down Victor," says Nathan. "I had a bad tooth ache the other day and went to see my dentist. He checked my tooth and said I needed root canal treatment. And after removing the infected nerve, he gave me some pills and said it was very important that I eat on the other side for the next few days. So here I am."

"Well surely you don't want the sandwich to fall on the floor again?" says the waiter.

But the man says, "It really is Rivkah bas Tzvi."

"I'm confused then," says the gabbai. "How can that really be your name?"

The man answers, "I'm currently having some major financial problems and everything, and I mean everything, has been put in my wife's name."

### #2099 The audition

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

Monty and Rachel, both in their 70's, are walking past the Dominion Theatre one lunch time, when they notice a crowd gathered outside the Theatre entrance. "What do you think is happening?" asks Rachel.

"I read about this in today's Times," Monty replies. "They're casting for Star Wars The Musical."

Rachel is a bit hard of hearing and says, "What did you say? Are whores unusual?"

"No Rachel," replies Monty, "I said, Star Wars The Musical. It's a new show that's soon going to be running here."

"Did you say it's soon going to be raining here?" asks Rachel.

Monty knows what to do whenever Rachel acts this way. So he adjusts the volume on Rachel's hearing aid to its highest setting. Then he replies, "No Rachel, they're auditioning for a new musical show."

"Wow!" says Rachel. "Ever since I was a little girl, I've always yearned to be on the stage. If you don't mind, I think I'll join the queue for the auditions. Where will I find you afterwards?"

"We just passed a pub on the corner of the road. I'll be in there. Best of luck."

Two hours later, Rachel enters the pub with a large smile on her face. "You look remarkably happy," says Monty."

"What do you mean I look remarkably crappy?" asks Rachel.

Once again Monty reaches over and turns up Rachel's hearing aid volume. "I said you look remarkably happy. How did the audition go?"

"Oh, I'm so thrilled, Monty," replies Rachel. "I've got the part of Deaf Aider."

### #2101 A different kind of help

Emanuel Solomons flicks through the Yellow pages, finds the name of a local psychiatrist, and makes an appointment to see him. A week later, Emanuel enters Dr Kotik's consulting room and lies down on the couch.

"So how can I help you?" asks Dr Kotik.

"Don't be funny, doctor," replies Emanuel. "Can't you see who I am? I am Napoleon the Great. I am the greatest and I don't need anyone's help. I have a large army ready to invade Austria and Russia, and we will win, doctor, we will win. So I don't need your help."

"So if you don't need my help, why have you come to see me?" asks Dr Kotic.

"I've come here to get your advice on my wife," replies Emanuel. "You see, she just doesn't know who she is. She won't stop telling everyone that her name is Mrs Solomons!"

[My thanks to Asher P for the following]

It's 10pm and Hannah is sitting in her lounge quietly reading a fashion magazine. On the other side of the room, her husband Benny is watching TV.

But Benny is very agitated and keeps on switching channels. Eventually, Hannah says to him, "For goodness sake, Benny, stop going backwards and forwards will you. Just find a channel you like and watch it."

"I wish I could," replies Benny, "but I'm confused. At this moment, there's a very important game of golf being shown on channel 26, and you know how much I like golf. But on channel 99, they're showing a triple X rated film called,  'How couples can achieve mutual orgasm.' I just don't know whether to watch a young couple enjoying unbridled sex, or else watch golf."

"I don't know why you're finding it so difficult to choose," says Hannah. "You already know how to play golf."

### #2104 The wise rabbi

Morris stops going to shul soon after his barmitzvah. He doesn't really think anything can be gained by going to shul, and anyway, he likes to go out on Saturday mornings. Ten years later, he's talking to an old friend of his and after a long and serious discussion, Morris realises that he should never have taken a decision to stop attending shul. So even though he knows how painful it's going to be, he makes an appointment to see Rabbi Bloom, his rabbi who he's not spoken to since his barmitzvah.

"Rabbi," says Morris, "I'm so, so sorry. I've been a bad Jew. I decided in error 10 years ago that I would never need to go to shul again. But I now know that I made a bad decision. It was a mistake. So I want to tell you that from now onwards, you'll regularly see me in shul."

"My dear Morris," says Rabbi Bloom, "there was no need at all for you to apologise. These things happen from time to time but, thank God, most congregants eventually come back into the fold. I'm so glad to hear that I will see you again in shul. But I must point out to you that going to shul doesn't make you a Jew any more than going to a poultry farm makes you a chicken!"

[My thanks to Laurence F for the following]

Nathan leaves his house in London and flies to New York to visit his son David. As soon as the plane lands and Nathan clears security, there is David waiting for him. "So how was your journey, dad?" asks David.

Nathan replies, " Do you remember me telling you last week of the giant Piers Morgan posters that have begun appearing all over the place announcing that he's been given the CNN chat show?"

"Yes dad," replies David.

"And do you remember me telling you that almost immediately, people began mistaking me for Piers Morgan?"

"Yes dad, you did," replies David.

"Well," continues Nathan, "you wouldn't guess what happened to me as soon as I stepped off the plane. An elderly Jewish lady with a large chai around her neck and wearing thick horn-rimmed glasses comes over to me, points at my face, and says, 'Excuse me, it's you, isn't it?'"

"Did you tell her she was making a mistake and that you were not Piers Morgan?" asks David.

"No, I never got the chance," replies Nathan. "Before I could open my mouth, she points at me again and says, 'It really, really is you, isn't it? I'm sure it's you. Go on, tell me, it is you isn't it?'  I don't know what made me say it, David, but I replied, 'Yes it is.'  And to be honest, just at that moment, I felt like a million dollars.  But then she gets serious. She looks me in the eyes and says, 'Vhell mister builder? So vhen are you going to come back and finish off painting the front of my apartment?'"

As they pull up at traffic lights, Rebecca happens to glance out of her window and sees, in the car next to them, a woman breastfeeding her young baby. Rebecca immediately goes all gooey-eyed and says to Harry, "As soon as I lose some weight, Harry, I want us to try again for a daughter. Maybe this time HaShem will give us what we've always wanted."

Harry immediately reaches into the dash, removes an already opened box of Belgium chocolates, and gives it to Rebecca. "Here, darling," he says, "we're still some way from home, so why don't you finish off the chocolates?"

Little Lawrence immediately puts up his hand and replies, "Yes rabbi, I know the answer. It's my mother."

While Miriam is out shopping, she sees her next door neighbour Leah. "I'm so glad we've met," says Miriam, "because I've been wanting to discuss something with you about the Smiths - you know, the couple  who recently moved into our street."

"So tell me already," says Leah, "what about them?"

"Have you met Mrs Smith yet?" asks Miriam.

"No I haven't," replies Leah.

"Well I have," says Miriam, "and I tell you Leah, she's not a very nice woman. All she did was complain about her shmendrick of a husband. She spoke non stop about the poor man for at least 15 minutes on what he does wrong, what he should have done but didn't, why he doesn't earn enough money, how he takes a bath only once a month, and so on."

"Oy, that wasn't very nice of her," says Leah.

"You can say that again, Leah," says Miriam. "I know my husband Shmuel doesn't help me with any of the household chores, lies to me a lot, doesn't go to shul as regularly as he should, spends our hard earned money on the horses, drinks too much whiskey, flirts with all the ladies even though he's a very poor lover, and that sometimes I just wish he would drop down dead. But even so, I just wouldn't go around telling everybody about him."

### #2114 What a mix-up!

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Moshe the Florist is in his shop arranging some flowers when his phone rings. "Hello," says Moshe, "how can I help you?"

"Help me?" says the lady caller. "That's a laugh. You can't help me. My name is Freda Cohen and I'm ringing to complain about the terrible service I've just had from you. You've got a chutzpah calling yourself a florist."

"So what's the problem, Mrs Cohen?" asks Moshe.

"Well last week," replies Freda, "I relocated my kosher restaurant to Golders Green and today is my Grand Opening. So nu? What do I receive from your shop? A funeral wreath, that's what. And not only that - it came with the message: -

SORRY TO HEAR THE NEWS

WITH SINCEREST SYMPATHIES

"Is this some kind of chauvinist  joke you're pulling?" asks Freda. "Are you trying to run my new shop down before it's even started?"

Moshe immediately realises that he must have mixed up two orders and sent them to the wrong addresses.

"I'm terribly, terribly sorry Mrs Cohen," says Moshe, "It's not like me to make such a mistake. I've obviously mixed up two orders and sent each to the wrong customer. I'll send you the correct order right away."

"OK, but who got my order, and what was the message I should have received with it?" asks Freda.

Moshe looks up his records and then goes white - because he realises that  instead of receiving the funeral wreath, the other customer had received a large vase containing masses of velvety, deep red roses with a black ribbon on them with the message: -

BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR NEW LOCATION

### #2115 The present

It's 8am in the morning and Miriam finally awakens from a deep sleep. She immediately turns to her husband Jonathan, nudges him, and says, "Oy darling, what a lovely dream I've just had."

"I dreamed that you gave me a beautiful 1 carat diamond ring for our wedding anniversary. That's what I just dreamed."

"Mazeltov on your dream," says Jonathan.

"So what do you think such a dream means?" asks Miriam. "After all, it's our anniversary tomorrow."

"Be patient," replies Jonathan. "Wait until tonight when I get back from work and then you'll know what it means."

All day long, Miriam can't think of anything other than the diamond ring. Finally, Jonathan returns home. As soon as he takes off his coat, he hands Miriam a gold paper wrapped small package. Excited, Miriam immediately opens it and inside finds a book titled, 'The Meanings Of All Your Dreams.'

### #2117 The wrong date

Talya, aged 29, has not been able to find a suitable man to marry, so her mother contacts a shadchen and a date is hastily arranged. The morning after the date, Talya's best friend Natalie phones her to find out how she got on.

"If you really want to know what I thought of Arnold," says Talya, "I can tell you that it was the worst date I have ever been on. What a nebbish he turned out to be. I had an awful time."

"Oh Talya," says Natalie, "I'm so sorry to hear that. So where did he take you?"

"He took me to a kosher snack bar," replies Talya. "But once inside, Arnold just didn't seem to notice that everyone there seemed to me to be over 50. Then he ordered food for us without even asking me what I wanted. He ordered cold salt beef sandwiches on rye bread with latkes followed by lemon tea. There was no wine - and you know how much I love wine with my meals."

"So what did you do after that?" asks Natalie.

"He took me to a dance at his local club," replies Talya. "Not many people were there and the music played was so out-of-date that I turned down most of his requests to get up and dance with him. And even when I did dance with him, his dancing ability was ....., well you just don't want to know about it."

"So what did you talk about?" asks Natalie.

"We didn't talk much because he knew almost gornisht about my favourite celebrities and pop stars."

"So why did you agree to go out with him in the first place?" asks Natalie.

"It was entirely my fault," replies Talya. "I should have known right from the start how my evening was going to turn out because he arrived at my house in a 1950 silver Bentley Continental."

"Wow!" says Natalie. "But that wouldn't have been reason to turn him down - he must be quite a rich guy. A Bentley is a very expensive and desirable car."

"I know it is," replies Talya, "but he was also the original owner of the car - he bought it from new!"



gornisht: nothing

shadchen: matchmaker

nebbish: a nobody, inept, innocuous, ineffectual

As he does this, one of his fellow professors notices that instead of having a very contented look on his face, Albert Einstein appears very gloomy. So he follows Albert Einstein to his study and says to him, "What a fantastic, brilliant speech, Albert. I have never heard anything finer. But why are you looking so down-in-the-mouth? What possible reason can you have for looking so unhappy?"

"Thank you my friend for thinking of me," replies Albert Einstein. "But I have reason enough to be sad. My wife doesn't understand me."

Emma doesn't know why he does this so one evening she asks him, "Darling tell me the truth. You don't like my singing?"

"Why do you ask?" he replies.

"Because every time I start singing when you're at home, you get up and stand on our doorstep," she replies.

"Well actually I quite like your singing," says Joshua, "but I just want to make sure that our neighbours don't think I'm beating you."

"Hello Victor," says Emanuel, looking closely at the book Victor is reading.

"Why hello Emanuel," says Victor, looking up.

"What book are you reading?" asks Emanuel.

"I'm reading a history book, Emanuel," replies Victor.

Emanuel has already seen the book's title, so pointing to the book, he says, "But Victor, that's a book about sex, isn't it?"

"Yes, Emanuel, you're very observant," replies Victor. "But you see, for me this book really is a history book."

### #2130 There's a reason - I'm not stupid

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

It's gone 11pm and Isaac is driving his girlfriend Sarah home after enjoying a great evening out in a London disco. They are still some way from her house when, after much discussion, they decide to  look for a quiet place to park. Isaac soon finds a suitable lay-by in a very dark deserted road, parks his car, turns on his internal reading light, takes out a computer magazine, and starts to read.

But a passing police car notices Isaac's car parked just off the main road with it's reading light on and stops to investigate. The police officer walks over to Isaac's car, looks inside and is surprised to see the driver reading a magazine and a girl sitting in the back seat. So he taps on the window.

"Can I help you officer?" asks Isaac, lowering his window.

"Please tell me what you're doing parked here in this deserted road. Are you up to some mischief?" asks the officer.

"Not at all, officer," replies Isaac, "I'm just reading my magazine."

"And the young lady sitting in the back seat," says the officer, "what is she doing?"

"Isaac turns round, looks at Sarah, and replies, "I think she's doing her nails, officer."

The officer is still a bit suspicious, so he turns to Isaac, looks him in the eyes and asks, "What's your name and how old are you?"

Isaac replies, "My name is Isaac Levy and I'm 20 years old, officer."

Pointing to Sarah, the officer then asks, "and who is the girl in the back seat and how old is she?"

Looking carefully at his watch, Isaac replies, "Her name is Sarah Goldman, officer, and in  ..........13 minutes, 12 seconds time, she'll be 16 years old."

Not long afterwards, Isaac drives Esther into town, parks the car and takes Esther to buy her present. As they approach the shop, Isaac says to her, "OK Petal, my little Honeybunch, why don't you browse around. Choose anything you like and when you've chosen, I'll come over and pay for it."

Although Esther is quite excited by this, she is still suspicious because to family and friends, Isaac is known as a karger. As she goes into the shop, she happens to look up and her smile is quickly wiped off her face. The sign above the door says, WELCOME TO POUNDSTRETCHER

NOTE: For those of you who are worried about Isaac, I've been told that he's expected to be fit enough to leave hospital next week



kush: a kiss

Petal, Honeybunch: terms of endearment

karger: a cheapskate, a miser, a skinflint, a tightwad

### #2133 The theft of a violin

During Joshua's trial for stealing an expensive violin, Max, his defence counsel, asks him, "I'm astonished, Joshua, to see you here in court today. You're Jewish, aren't you?"

"Yes I am," replies Joshua, "and I'm proud to be so."

"That's why I'm so surprised about the theft allegation made against you," says Max. "Jews very rarely get involved in criminal theft because it's just not in their character to steal. Am I correct?"

"Yes, you're correct," says Joshua.

"OK," says Max. "So coming back to the accusation that you stole the violin, you can't play a violin can you Joshua?"

"No," replies Joshua, "I can't even play one note on a violin."

"Well if you can't play even one note on a violin," says Max, "why did you take the violin from your next door neighbour?".

"Because," replies Joshua, "my neighbour has been driving me mad at night - he also can't play a single note on a violin!"

### #2134 The walls of Jericho

During his morning cheder class, Maurice, the Jewish history teacher, asks young Simon Levy, "Who blew down the walls of Jericho, Simon?"

Simon answers, "It wasn't me, teacher. Honest."

Maurice is surprised by Simon's answer and decides to phone Simon's father after class.

"Mr Levy," he says, "I thought I should tell you something about your son Simon. Just now, during my history class, I asked him who blew down the walls of Jericho and was surprised when he answered that it wasn't him."

"Well," says Mr Levy, "my Simon is an honest boy, a mensh even. If my Simon says it wasn't him, then I can guarantee you it wasn't him."

Within minutes, the 'Jericho story' starts going round the school until near to home time, the school's rabbi calls into Maurice's office and says, "I've just heard that when you asked Simon Levy who blew down the walls of Jericho, he said it wasn't him. Is that true, Maurice?"

"Yes," replies Maurice. "And I can also confirm that his father vouches for Simon's total honesty."

The rabbi goes immediately into the Chairman's office and says, "Mr Chairman, I think you'll be interested in this story about Simon Levy. When his teacher Maurice asked him who blew down the walls of Jericho, Simon said it wasn't him. And to back it up, Simon's father vouched for his son's honesty. So I then asked Maurice whether he ....

At his point, the Chairman interrupts and says, "OK, alright already. You don't need to go on, rabbi. I've got an important meeting to attend in 5 minutes time. Just arrange to get the walls fixed as soon as you can and ask the builder to send me his invoice."

[My thanks to Asher P for the following]

One morning during breakfast, Rivkah notices that her husband Maurice is unusually quiet. So she asks him, "Oy Maurice, why the silence? Normally I can't get you to stop talking during breakfast."

"It's just hit me hard Rivkah," he replies, "that I'm 60 years old and no longer a young man. So I've been doing a lot of thinking."

"So tell me already," she asks, "what great conclusion have you come to?"

"Well for one thing," he replies, "if I were to die suddenly in the not-too-distant future, I'd want you to immediately sell all my belongings."

"That's a bit negative, isn't it Maurice?" replies Rivkah. "But in any case, why would you want me to sell all of your belongings?"

"Well I believe that not long after I die, you'd probably remarry. And I definitely don't want some shmuck using my things."

With a serious look on her face, Rivkah says, "So what makes you think that I would want to marry another shmuck?"

"Thanks for the invite," replies Daniel. "Carolyn's not going to her Israeli dance class on Sunday and so we would be glad to come over to see this wondrous new modern house of yours - and no doubt plutz a bit as well."

"Great," says Arnold. "Do you need directions to get here?"

It was then that her bubbeh gives Rachel her wedding present. Rachel opens the parcel, looks at the present, then rummages around a bit. Then she goes over to her bubbeh, kisses her, and says, "Oh bubbeh, thank you so much for this lovely present."

Oy, darling," says bubbeh, "I'm so pleased that you like it."

"What new bride wouldn't like such a magnificent solid silver sewing basket," says Rachel. "It's got all the bits and pieces inside - reels of cotton, needles of all sizes, two lovely silver thimbles, and other things that I don't recognise. But bubbeh, I've already looked inside the basket - there doesn't seem to be any instruction leaflet. Do you know where it is?"

[My thanks to Howard K for the following]

Bernie is out shopping one morning when he bumps into his old school friend Daniel whom he hasn't seen for 40 years. Naturally, they start talking about their school days and in particular their school friends.

"Do you remember that blond girl all the boys used to call 'no boobs Sharon'?" asks Bernie.

"Actually," replies Daniel, "I remember her very well. She was the pretty little blond girl who unfortunately had, how shall I put it, ......a 'flat chest' and as a result, always had trouble getting boys to go out with her. Why do you ask?"

"Well she lives just around the corner to me," replies Bernie, "and you should see her now." And as he says this, Bernie cups his hands and shapes his fingers as if he is holding two melons.

"Really?" replies Daniel. "Then she was obviously a late developer. I'm so pleased everything turned out well for her."

Bernie then cups his hands again, this time straining his fingers as much as he could.

Daniel stares at Bernie's fingers and says, "Are you trying to tell me that Sharon is now actually super endowed?"

"No I'm not," replies Bernie. "You don't understand. What I'm trying to tell you is that Sharon has a bad case of arthritis and her hands are badly deformed."

### #2144 The JC interview

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

It's Oy Veh Ltd's 10th anniversary and the JC has decided to publish an article on  the company and how it has managed to survive the recession. So one of the JC reporters is sent out to interview Sidney Offenbach, the MD.

"Mr. Offenbach," says the reporter, "I'd like to start by asking you to describe your employees, what they do and how much each earns."

"No problem," says Sidney. "In total, there are only two employees. First of all there's my office clerk. He's been with me for 5 years now and I couldn't do without him. He works a full 8 hour day for 5 days a week and for that I pay him £25,000 per year. I also provide him with a free lunchtime salt beef sandwich and a herbal tea. Oh, and I also let him use my small one bed apartment for next to gornisht."

"And then there's the office shmuck," continues Sidney. "He's been with Oy Veh ever since it opened for business 10 years ago. He works 9 hours a day without a break for 7 days a week and probably handles 80% of all the work that has to be carried out. In total, he takes home no more than £5,000 per year, but as he also has to pay for his own accommodation, I buy him a bottle of whisky every few days or so to help him cope with everything that he's faced with.  And that's not all. He also sleeps with my wife whenever he's not too tired to do so."

"Thank you Mr Offenbach," says the JC reporter, "that's very interesting. If it's alright with you, I'd like to talk to this person, this person you call the office shmuck. Can you take me to him please?"

"I don't need to," replies Sidney, "you're looking at him right now."

### #2148 Is variety the spice of life?

[My thanks to Emmanuel for the following]

Today is the end of Jacob's first day at his new school. His father Sidney, an agnostic Jew, believes that his son is privileged to go to this particular school because it instils in its pupils a strong focus on liberalism and multiculturalism. So as soon as Jacob returns home, Sidney asks him, "So how was your first day, Jacob?"

"Well dad," replies Jacob, "I've already made some new friends. And not only do they come from countries all over the world, they pray to different Gods. One of them, in fact, has more than one God and he asked me how many Gods I have. But I couldn't tell him. So tell me dad, how many Gods do we have?"

"Well, Jacob," replies Sidney, "you should know that we have only one God, Ha-Shem we call him, but we don't believe in him."



Ha-Shem: God: literally 'The Name.' Jews consider that saying the real name of God is blasphemy.

"I couldn't," says Lionel, "because it was a Jewish Holy Day."

"Mr Levy," says the manager, "I'm surprised because I deal with a lot of Jewish clients and I thought I knew all of the Jewish Holy Days. So which Holy Day are you referring to?"

### #2152 The obsession

Jacob and his best friend Sidney are having a quiet chat about the advantages and disadvantages of marrying young. "I met my Naomi over 50 years ago," says Jacob, "when we were both 16. And almost immediately we started shtupping in my bedroom whilst my parents were out. It didn't take me long to propose to her."

"Wow!" says Sidney. "So you obviously believe in marrying young."

"Yes, you could say that," replies Jacob, "but there can also be problems if you marry before you really know your partner well. In my case, the disadvantage in marrying Naomi before I really knew her still affects me today."

"So tell me already," says Sidney.

"I was a very messy teenager, a shloch even," says Jacob. "Right from the start, every time we went up to my bedroom to shtup, Naomi looked around and said, 'Oy, what a shmutzy room. I'm not making love in here until it's been cleaned up.' And she meant it. She refused point blank to do so until she had thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly, cleaned and tidied up my room. I didn't know then that Naomi had and still has a major obsession with cleanliness."

"OK, but that was 50 years ago," says Sidney. "Why does her obsession affect you today?"

"Because every time I hear Naomi turn on the vacuum cleaner," replies Jacob, "I get an instant erection."



shtup/shtupping: make/making love

shloch: untidy slob

shmutzy: dirty

### #2153 High priority

When David, an up and coming author of Jewish joke books, arrives home after work, he's greeted at the front door by his wife Sonia. She's sobbing hysterically.

"What's the matter darling?" asks David, putting his arms around her and cuddling her.

"Oy Vay," cries Sonia, "there's been a terrible fire in our kitchen. I was frying some fish for our dinner when the phone rang. It was your agent wanting to bring you up to date with her progress in finding a publisher. But while I was talking to her, I didn't notice that I'd left the gas on high and within minutes the oil was ablaze.

### #2157 A musical discussion

[My thanks to Peter M for the following]

Father Casey and Rabbi Levy are great friends and often meet for coffee at Brent Cross Shopping Centre where they discuss issues mainly of a religious nature. But today, they are talking about music, all types of music.

After 30 minutes of discussion, Rabbi Levy says, "So far, Father, we have agreed on most things musical. But I have to be honest - there is one piece of music that has always annoyed me."

"So what's that, Rabbi?" asks Father Casey.

"It's a song of yours that I've always hated, but unfortunately I just can't remember its name."

Just at that moment, Rabbi Levy overhears a lady talking on the table behind him. He can't hear exactly what she's saying but by the tone of her voice,  she's obviously kvetching and kretchzing about something.

Rabbi Levy immediately says, "I remember now, Father, what it's called. It's called Oy Vay Maria."



kvetching: fretting, complaining, griping, grunting, sighing, moaning,

krechtzing: fussing and complaining with audible sound effects such as grunts ands groans

### #2158 Granting of the wish

[My thanks to Steven S for the following]

Moshe is tired of putting in a solid 8 hours at work every day for 6 days a week whereas his wife Rachel just has to stay at home. He thinks that this division of their time is quite unfair. They always argue about it, but Moshe can never get Rachel to see his side of things. So one morning he prays to God. "Dear Lord, please help me show my wife Rachel just what I have to go through every day. So I wish that Rachel and I could swap bodies for a day thus allowing her to see exactly what I have to go through."

God, in his infinite wisdom, grants Moshe his wish and next morning he wakes up as his wife.

Moshe gets dressed and cooks breakfast for his 'husband' who gulps it down without saying much and leaves for work. Moshe then goes upstairs and wakes up the children. He puts their school clothes on their beds and goes downstairs to make their breakfast After much shouting to them to come downstairs, they eventually put in an appearance. He packs their school lunches and drives them to their respective schools (which are 3 miles apart.)

On his way back home, Moshe stops off at Barclays Bank, queues for 10 minutes and eventually deposits some cheques. He then drives home, picks up the dry cleaning, gets back into his car and drives to the dry cleaners. He then goes into the kosher Deli and buys a roasting chicken, some fruit and vegetables and some Tomar margarine, queues at the check-out, then drives back home. He puts away the groceries, then gets out the mop and cleans the kitchen and toilet floors.

Moshe then sits down, checks all their outstanding invoices, chooses which need urgently paying, writes out the necessary cheques, puts them in envelopes, addresses them, and then walks the 300m to the nearest post box. When he returns, he takes their dog upstairs, bathes and dries him, then cleans and dries the bathroom floor. He then sits down for a quick bite to eat - a couple of slices of challah with some sardines and cucumber and a cup of tea. After he's washed and dried up, he goes upstairs, makes the three beds, picks up all the clothing littered on the floor and puts them in the washing machine. While he waits for the washing machine to finish, he does some dusting and some vacuuming.

He looks at his watch and, Oy Vay, it's time to pick up the kids from school. So he  gets back in the car and drives to the two schools. In the car on their way back home, the children start arguing and hitting each other and he has to stop the car and read out the riot act to them. Back home, he makes them some milk shakes (one raspberry and one blackcurrant) and puts some biscuits on a plate.  When they've finished, he washes up then spends time helping them with their homework - one has the history of King James I and the other has the life of Abraham and Sarah.  Later, the boys rush upstairs to play on their computers. Moshe gets out the ironing board and does some ironing, interspersed with going upstairs on a regular basis to check that neither boy is looking at any prohibited material. He then peels the potatoes, washes and slices the vegetables, cuts the bread, and peels the fruit in readiness for their evening meal (tonight it's roast chicken.)

His 'husband' returns from work and not long after, they have their evening meal. As soon as it's finished, the men go into the lounge and watch TV while Moshe cleans the table of plates etc and puts them in the dishwasher. Soon after, Moshe has a hard job getting the boys to move away from the TV and go upstairs for their bath - his 'husband' doesn't help. Eventually Moshe gets the children washed, dried and put into bed. He then goes downstairs and puts his feet up. He watches TV for a while. Not long after, Moshe goes to bed - and although he's tired out and just wants to go to sleep, his 'husband' first of all requires some lovemaking. This Moshe just about manages to complete he goes to sleep at last.

When he wakes up next morning, he's still in Rachel's body, so he prays again to God. "Dear Lord, I have learned a hard lesson. I was totally wrong to think my Rachel has an easy job. I now know she has a much harder job to do than mine, and it's much more tiring as well. So please could you swap our bodies back."

God, in his infinite wisdom, replies, "My son, I feel that you have learned your lesson and so I will be happy to change things back to the way they were ...but you'll have to wait nine months before I swap you both back.  Your 'husband' got you pregnant last night."

"I'm glad to hear it," says Joshua, "the salt beef is OK but the rye bread must be yesterday's bread."

"Mazeltov," says Hannah. "So what's the job like?"

At first, Hannah can't help smiling at this news, but then she gets serious and says to him, "That's sounds great, darling, but what's the catch? There must be a catch somewhere."

"No, there's no catch," replies Benny. "You start tomorrow."

"Please explain why you want me to excuse you from Jury Service, Mr Gold." asks the judge.

"Because I'm prejudiced, that's why," replies Moshe. "I've  always been a prejudiced person."

"Give me an example," says the judge.

"Well," replies Moshe, "I'm looking at the prisoner right now and I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that from the way he looks, he's absolutely, definitely guilty."

"Mr Gold," says the judge, "the prisoner is not yet in court. The man you're looking at is the prisoner's barrister!"

### #2166 The joke's on you

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Peter, a well known anti-semite, walks into a bar and is about to order a drink when he sees a  guy close by with kippa, tzitzis, and payess. He doesn't have to be an Einstein to know that this guy is Jewish. So Peter shouts over to the bartender so everyone can hear, "Drinks for everyone in here, bartender, but not for that guy over there," pointing to the Jewish guy.

Soon after the drinks have been handed out, Peter notices that the Jewish guy is smiling. This infuriates him and in a loud voice, he once again orders  drinks for everyone except the Jewish guy. But as before, this does not seem to worry the Jewish guy who continues to smile. So he says to the barman, "What the hell's the matter with that guy over there, barman? I've ordered two round of drinks for everyone in the bar except that guy, and all he does is smile and look happy. Is he mentally retarded or what?"

"No, he's absolutely normal," replies the barman. "He's the owner of this bar."

The clerk smiles and says, "Appendectomy - that's a very big word for a little girl. Do you know what it means?"

"Of course I do," replies Sarah, "I'm not stupid.  It means £3,500 and it doesn't include the cost of my uncle, the anaesthetist."

### #2168 You're never alone

15 year old Jonathan, a member of the London Maccabi Club, is on his first club adventure holiday during which he is hopefully going to learn all about out-of-town survival. Together with 10 other teenagers and Emanuel, their group leader, they have arrived at their destination, a forest in the middle of France. There are no other people around for miles.

Emanuel asks Jonathan to help him unpack their survival equipment. As he unpacks, Jonathan finds ropes, hunting knives, torches, matches, compasses, flare rockets, walkie-talkie radios, and emergency rations. But what surprises Jonathan most is a sealed cardboard box with a Magen David on it labelled, "Ingredients plus recipe leaflet for making matzo balls."

So he says, "I don't understand this box, Emanuel. Why do I need to know how to make matzo balls? How is this going to help me if I get stranded somewhere?"

### #2180 Duplicate not allowed

Sheldon is a hoarder. He's been accumulating collectables (or drek as his wife Golda calls them) for many, many years. His study is full to overflowing with them.

One night, as he and Golda get into bed, Sheldon says, "I've been thinking, Golda. If I were to suddenly die, God forbid, I would like you to do something for me."

"And what is that?" asks Golda, looking bored.

"I would want you to sell everything that I've collected over these past 20 years. Will you promise me that you'll do that?"

"But why would you want me to sell your drek?" asks Golda. "You've always told me how precious and important they all are."

"They are," says Sheldon. "But when I die, no doubt you'll immediately start looking for another man. Eventually you'll marry him and I don't want some shmuck holding my collectables in his grubby little hands."

"And what makes you think I'd marry another shmuck?" says Golda.

Six months after Irvine waves goodbye to his parents at the airport, his parents have still heard nothing from him and they are obviously getting quite worried for his safety, and especially after they are told by the University of Montana that Irvine only attended his course for a few weeks before quitting.

But then, one morning they get a letter from him. Here is what it said:

### #2196 Totality

Rabbi Shmuel dies and is now standing in a line of people waiting  to find out whether they are going to heaven - a line containing, among others, the righteous, academics, religious leaders, and the virtuous. As Rabbi Shmuel looks around, he sees an angel bowing down and talking with respect to a rather rough looking man. The angel then leads this man to the front of the line.

Rabbi Shmuel is very surprised by this action. "How odd," he says to himself. "It seems that this ordinary looking man is going to get precedence over all of us here. Who can this man be?"

The angel notices the look of surprise on Rabbi Shmuel's face and so goes over to him and says, "I know it looks a bit odd, rabbi, but this man is a taxi driver."

"But if that is all, why does it make him a special person?" asks Rabbi Shmuel.

"Let me explain, rabbi," replies the angel. "It's simple really. We obviously realise up here that in your lifetime, you have influenced quite a lot of people and explained to them why they should believe in Hashem. But the thousands of people who have travelled in this man's taxi immediately began to pray with 100% total sincerity."

"You've got a black smudge on your face and lips," replies Natalie, still smiling. "What have you been up to then?"

Wiping his face with his handkerchief, Hyman replies, "I've been up to nothing, Natalie. My wife Sadie left this morning for a 2-week stay in Manchester with her brother and his family. And to ensure that she would definitely get to the station on time, I took Sadie there by car. When the train arrived, I helped her to her seat, said 'zay gezunt,' and got off the train."

"But what about the black marks on your face?" asks Natalie.

"Well, because the train had arrived on schedule," replies Hyman, "I was assured of 2 weeks of blissful peace. So as soon as I got off, I ran up to the front of the train and gave it a big 'thank-you' kush."

### #2200 A visit to the vet

NB An updated version of joke #584 (24th set of jokes)

Paul is worried about his dog Patrick and takes him to see Dr. Simon, the local vet.

"My dog has a problem, doctor," says Paul.

"OK, so tell me already about your dog and his problem," says doctor Simon.

"Well, doctor," replies Paul, "despite his name, Patrick is a Jewish dog. And not only that, Patrick can talk."

"You're joking, surely?" asks doctor Simon.

"No I'm not," replies Paul. "Just watch this."

Paul then looks Patrick in the eye and says, "Patrick, fetch."

Immediately, Patrick starts to walk toward the door. But then he stops, turns around, looks at Paul and says, "Why, oh why, do you continue to talk to me like that, Paul? You're always ordering me around like I'm a nothing, a gornisht. You only seem to talk to me when you want something. How degraded I feel. And that's not all. You always force me to sleep on the cold, tiled floor at night - and me with my arthritis! And you persist in giving me unhealthy fahkahkta food which contains a lot of salt and fat. Do you really think I'm going to fall for your claim that it's a special diet? It tastes like dreck! You should try eating it yourself. And do you and Natalie ever take me for a decent walk around Bushey? No you don't. It's always just out of the house, a short pish, and then right back home again. Oy vey! If I could only stretch out a little, maybe my sciatica wouldn't hurt me so much! I should roll over and play dead for real, for all you care about me."

Dr. Simon is absolutely gobsmacked. "This is absolutely incredible. I've never heard of such a talking dog. But why have you brought him here? What medical problem does Patrick have?"

"He has a very bad hearing problem, doctor," replies Paul, "I said 'Fetch,' not 'Kvetch'."



gornisht: nothing

fahkahkta: shitty

dreck: rubbish

pish: to urinate

kvetch: complain

Hearing the word 'single' was music to Leah's ears. "That's nice, Mervyn," she says. "You really must meet my daughter Naomi. She's also single and  ....."

Mervyn interrupts her and says, "It would be a waste of time, Mrs Gold. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I'm gay."

Jeremy likes a bit of a gamble from time to time and decides to go to Ascot to bet on the Derby. During the afternoon, he gets lucky and wins £950. As a result, the following Sunday sees Jeremy and his wife Judith celebrating the win.

Deciding to travel everywhere by taxi, they first of all go to the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane  for some lunch.  As soon as they are shown to their table, Jeremy gives Judith a wad of £10 notes and whispers to her, "Darling, may I suggest you go to the Ladies and hide these notes on you somewhere safe. I'll be asking you for some of them as and when we need to pay."

"OK," she says, and does what he has suggested.

They have a super lunch at The Hilton and when they finish, Jeremy quietly asks for and is given cash by Judith to pay for their meal.

Then it's on to The Prince Edward Theatre where they buy top price tickets at the box office to see 'Jersey Boys.' Jeremy again quietly asks for and is given cash by Judith to pay for the tickets. It turns out to be a fantastic show. Then it's on to the Ritz for a 5 course evening meal with champagne. At the end of their overwhelming fress-up, Jeremy asks Judith for cash to pay the bill.

But this time there's a problem as Judith quietly searches inside her bra for the cash. "Oy gevalt," she says to Jeremy, "the money is missing. It must have been stolen."

"What do you mean, 'it must have been stolen'?" says Jeremy. "How can that possibly have happened?"

"I think it must have been stolen by that young man who sat on the other side of me in the theatre," replies Judith. "His hands were everywhere. What a bondit he turned out to be."

"Judith," says Jeremy, "do you mean to tell me that you allowed a man you've never seen before to put his hand down your bra?"

"Don't be silly Jeremy," replies Judith. "How was I to know he was a gonif?"

"That's why I'm here rabbi," she replies, starting to cry. "Arnold and I have just had an awful fight, just awful."

"Don't cry," says Rabbi Levy, "this often happens soon after a marriage. So please calm down. I think every marriage has to have its first fight at sometime."

[My thanks to The IrRev for the following]

Not many people know this but there is a factory in Hendon that makes Jewish computers and only employs married Jewish men. This upsets many women who try to get a job there. One day, Rebecca calls in to talk to Benjamin, the factory's managing director.

"So how can I help you, Rebecca?" asks Benjamin.

"I would like you to explain why you only employ married Jewish men here," says Rebecca. "Why don't you also employ us women? Do you really think that we are so useless that we couldn't do whatever work was required here? Do you think that we women are all stupid, or weak, or what?"

"No, that's not the reason Rebecca," replies Benjamin. "We employ only married Jewish men because we find that they are the most experienced  employees at obeying orders given to them. I can shout at them and shove them around all day long and they never talk back, argue with me, or sulk."

### #2210 The final flood?

Within days of the giant Oyvey undersea volcano erupting, all the leading volcanic scientists are predicting  that an enormous tsunami will quickly follow. Not only that, many are saying that this tsunami spells the end of the world as we know it because it will cause nearly all land to be submerged to a depth of 20 metres. This leads to religious leaders appearing on television with their own distinct messages.

The Pope's message is one of encouragement. "By accepting Jesus Christ, your immortal souls will be saved."

A Muslim Imam recommends conversion. "If you follow the Islam faith, you can spend eternity with Allah."

The Dali Lama urges everyone to become Buddhist. "It will allow you to attain Nirvana."

The Israeli Chief Rabbi has a different kind of message. He says, "Go all of you to the coast, go to swimming pools, go even into your baths at home. Then practise hard. We only have 3 days to learn how to live under water."

### #2211 Job insurance

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Mervyn has recently graduated from Oxford University and is now ready to start applying for some jobs in the City's financial sector. But he feels that he needs to dress in the appropriate City style. So he goes to his father and says, "Dad, I need some money."

"What! More money yet?" says his father. "What do you think you need money for this time?"

"I need to buy a quality  pin-stripe suit for my interviews," replies Mervyn, "and New Bond Street has the best tailor shops in London."

"And how much is that quality suit going to cost me?" asks his father.

"At a guess, dad, about £750," replies Mervyn.

Mervyn's father goes red in the face, and almost gagging replies, "£750! Why I've bought cars in the past for less than £750."

"That's exactly why I need a good quality suit dad," replies Mervyn. "I need to ensure that I will never have to drive a £750 car."

### #2213 Why wasn't I told?

Ever since her batmitzvah, Sharon has always been a regular shul goer. The same cannot be said about her twin sister Rose who very rarely steps inside a shul. Today is Sharon and Rose's 60th birthday and during their celebrations, Sharon once again raises the subject of going to shul. But this time, to Sharon's surprise, Rose tells her that she has already started and has gone to shul on the last three shabbats.

Next day, Sharon goes to see Rabbi Levy and tells him about her sister's religious revival. "Rabbi," she says, "tell me, do you think my sister's sins can be forgiven, even after 48 years of never going to shul?"

"Yes Sharon," replies Rabbi Levy, "they certainly can. As it is said, 'the greater the number of sins, the greater the glory'."

"Oy vey, rabbi," says Sharon, "I wish I had been told about this 48 years ago!"



shul: synagogue

shabbat: The sabbath, which lasts from sundown on Friday to sunset on Saturday

"What's the matter bubbeleh?"  asks her mother. "Has anything happened?"

"Oh mummy," replies Misha, "I have a problem that I just can't seem to solve. Emanuel is very upset with me. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to satisfy him. I'm so miserable."

"Oy vey," says her mother. "But please don't blame yourself, Misha. It's not your fault. I obviously didn't teach you enough about the birds and the bees when you were growing up. Come round to my house right away and we'll talk more about it."

"Oh don't be silly mummy," says Misha, "I know perfectly well how to shtup.  It's how to cook that I know very little about!"

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Esther works for a firm of accountants. One day, with Rosh Hashanah fast approaching, she returns to her office from her lunch break carrying a plastic bag.

"What's in the bag, Esther?" asks Simon, who works with her.

"Just a dress I picked up from the dry cleaners," she replies.

"So show it to me already," he says.

Esther takes the dress out of the bag and holds it up.

"That's a real sexy looking dress," says Simon. "I suppose you'll be wearing it in shul on Rosh Hashanah?"

"Don't be silly," says Esther smiling. "It's not my dress. I've picked it up for my friend. And in any case Simon, be honest. Do you really believe someone with a figure as large as mine could get into a dress as small as this?"

Smiling, Simon replies, "Let me answer your question Esther with a question. Do you really believe that I've managed to live as long as I have by answering questions like the one you've just asked me?"

[My thanks to Frank R for the following]

Samuel and his long suffering wife Golda are queuing up in their local bank when, oy vey, two gonifs run into the bank. Each is wearing a handkerchief around their mouth and nose and each has a gun in their hand.

One of them points his gun at the customers and shouts out, "Listen all of you, stop screaming or else!"

There is instant silence. His colleague then runs over to a cashier and yells at him, "put all the money you have in your till on the counter."

The cashier immediately complies and the gonif starts to fill up his sack with the money. But as he's doing this, his handkerchief slips off.

As he repositions his handkerchief, he says to the cashier, "I'm sorry to do this, but you must have seen my face." He then shoots him.

Then turning to the shaking-with-fear customers, he says, "I hope no one else saw my face."

After a few moments of silence, a voice is heard. It's Golda's. She shouts out, "I think my husband might have caught a glimpse of you."

"What! Are you being serious?" replies Isaac. "If I do that, how will I make a living?"

### #2225 I know what it is

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

As Lionel and his wife Esther are leaving the Waitrose supermarket, Lionel notices that a weighing machine has recently been installed near the exit. As they walk up to the machine, he says to Esther, "What a good idea. It's just what someone like me, someone who's recently started a new diet, needs to use as often as possible."

Lionel gets onto the machine and reads the electronic display. "Oy vey," he says loudly to Esther, "this weighing machine must be faulty. The display indicates that I weigh more than I did two weeks ago. How can that be?"

But then, after a few seconds of thinking, Lionel takes off his cardigan and says to Esther, "I think I know what the problem might be. Here, hold this for me please."

He then gets back on the weighing machine, but it still doesn't give him the reading he was expecting. After a few more seconds of thought, Lionel shouts, "What a shmo I am. I have such a loch in kop. I know what it is." He then hands Esther his shopping bag and says, "Here, Esther, hold onto my pontshkes as well."

### #2226 Business is business

One day, as Leah is passing her daughter Miriam's apartment, she decides to drop in for a chat. Miriam is not only her eldest, but also the only one not yet married. Whilst they are having coffee, the doorbell rings. Miriam gets up and leaves the kitchen to answer the door.

Leah soon hears a man's voice, but he's talking too quietly for her to understand what he's saying. She does however hear  Miriam's reply.

"Thanks for asking. I'm very flattered because I have to admit that I very easily fall madly in love with men just like you. But somehow I always seem to frighten them away, and I don't understand why. All I want to do is move in with them, marry them and be the one to bear their sons and their daughters. Believe me, my whole being focuses on men like you."

Leah quickly gets up from her chair and walks over to the kitchen door to hear more clearly what is being said - especially as this man might be her next son-in-law. But she needn't have bothered because she hears the man's unemotional reply to Miriam. "Lady," she hears him say, "I can't stand here chatting. I've heard enough already. Just pay me for the pizza you ordered. I've got other deliveries to make."

"I'm on my way to visit my zaydeh," replies Monty. "We're going to play chess."

"Didn't you once tell me that your zaydeh was a good chess player?" asks Abe.

"Yes," replies Monty, "and he still is."

"And isn't your zaydeh also very frum?" asks Abe.

"He sure is," replies Monty. "In fact our family calls him the frumest chess player in the world."

"Why do you call him that?" asks Abe.

"Because he uses a special chess set he had made up to his own specification - a chess set where all the bishops have been replaced by rabbis."

### #2228  How to negotiate

Issy needs a new suit for work and decides to make a visit to MINKY THE TAILOR. A number of his friends had gone to this shop and they have all told him that the suits sold there are of high quality, yet not too expensive.

Immediately Issy enters the shop, a smartly dressed man goes over to him and says, "Good Morning, sir. I'm Dovid Minkovitch, the owner of this top class menswear shop. But you can call me Minky. In here you'll find the highest quality tailoring but without the need for any bargaining. And when you buy, you'll be able to wear my suits with naches."

"Bargaining, schbargaining," says Issy, "lets just get on vith it. Show me vot you've got, Minky."

30 minutes later, Issy has some mazel. He thinks he's found the perfect suit. "So nu, how much gelt is it?" asks Issy.

"Well," says Minky, "as you can see from the price tag, this suit will cost you £350. But I'm not going to give you such a fantastic suit for that price. I won't even give it to you for £330. It's yours for £310."

"I'm really glad to be doing business vith you, Minky. It's a real pleasure. So I vont insult you and offer you £240 for this fine suit. I von't even offer you £250.  My offer to you is £260."

"Vunderful," says Issy. "It's a metsieh. So wrap it up for me already."

"Who can this be at this hour?" he says to himself.

He picks up the phone and says, rather grumpily, "Yes, who am I talking to?"

"My name is Freda," comes the reply, "and I just wanted to let you know that the jacket I recently ordered from your shop is very nice."

"Well thank you Freda," says Minky. "But why did you have to ring me at 1 o'clock in the morning to tell me this?"

"Because your delivery van has just this minute woken me up to deliver it to me, that's why," replies Freda.

Morris and his wife Leah are in the middle of making love when Morris suddenly says, "I've been wanting to say this to you for some time, Leah. Why don't you moan a bit when we make love? We always seem to make love in total silence."

"Why do I have to moan?" replies Leah. "What good would it do?"

"I'm told it helps to sexually arouse those making love," replies Morris.

"All right Morris," says Leah, "if that's what you want, I'll do it. Shall I start moaning now?"

"No, not yet," replies Morris, getting all excited. "It's a bit too soon  ....... (pause) ..........I'll tell you when ........(pause) ........OK, Leah, so moan already."

"Oy vey, Morris," cries Leah, "I wish you would help me out in the house more often. You're always on your computer and I can never seem to find time talk to you. And we haven't been on holiday for years .............."

### #2231 What's the verdict?

Louis and Hymie are arguing strongly about a consignment of dried Israeli dates that Hymie has recently bought from Louis. "Just look at them," says Hymie. "Any shmuck can see that they are not fresh enough for me to sell in my shop. I want my money back. And if I don't get it, I'll have to find another distributor."

But Louis disagrees with him. "There is nothing at all wrong with these dates," he says, "so I won't be returning any money to you."

Their arguing gets so serious that they decide to go to Rabbi Levy for a decision.

Rabbi Levy hears both sides of the story, then without saying a word, takes a date from the box on the table, looks at it very carefully, removes the stone, pops the date into his mouth, chews it, swallows it, and then thinks for a few seconds. He then repeats his actions with other dates from the box, sometimes shaking his head after swallowing a date, sometimes nodding his head. After 10 minutes, Rabbi Levy takes out his handkerchief and wipes his lips.

Louis and Hymie now await Rabbi Levy's decision.

"So nu?" asks Hymie. "What's your verdict, Rabbi?"

"Yes, Rabbi," says Louis. "what do you think? Which one of us is right? We must know."

Rabbi Levy looks first at Louis, then at Hymie, then shrugging his shoulders replies, "Gentlemen, how should I know who's right? I'm a rabbi, not an expert on Israeli dates."

### #2232 Missing person

[My thanks to John B for the following]

Rachel decides to do some shopping at Brent Cross Shopping Centre and manages to persuade her husband Howard to join her. After 2 hours of looking around one women's clothes shop after another, Rachel suddenly realises that Howard is no longer with her. So she calls him on his mobile phone to see 'what's what.'

"So where are you?" she angrily asks Howard. "I thought we were shopping together."

"Don't get broyges, darling," replies Howard. "Do you remember the jewellery shop by the escalator in the middle of the Shopping Centre, the one we spent time in last year and where we saw a lovely gold necklace for you but which was just a little bit too expensive for us to buy and where I said I would get it for you one day?"

"Yes, of course I do, darling" replies Rachel excitedly. "Why do you ask?"

"Well I'm in the Cafe next door to that jewellery shop having a coffee and a scone."

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Ruben goes to see Rabbi Bloom. "Rabbi," he asks, "is it true that Jewish husbands can sleep with their wives on fast days?"

"Yes, Ruben," replies Rabbi Bloom, "that's correct."

"So does it follow," continues Ruben, "that a Jewish husband can also sleep with someone else's wife on fast days?"

"No, that is not correct," replies Rabbi Bloom.

"Why is that?" asks Ruben.

"Because the Torah clearly states that during fast days, we are not allowed to have any pleasure," replies Rabbi Bloom.

"Benny, you're looking oysegematert," says Laurence. "What's wrong?"

"I couldn't get to sleep last night, that's what's wrong," replies Benny. "Mine Hannah was moaning in her sleep all night long, shouting out the same words over and over again. And I got so worried and angry hearing them."

"So what were these words?" asks Laurence.

Trying to mimic his wife's voice, Benny replies, "NO JOSHUA NO, I'M TIRED!     NO JOSHUA NO, I'M TIRED!      NO JOSHUA NO, I'M TIRED!  And she kept on repeating them over and over and over again."

"So what don't you like about those words?" asks Laurence. "They don't seem very wrong to me."

"Of course they're wrong," says Benny. "My name isn't Joshua. So who can Joshua be?"

"Well obviously I don't know that," says Laurence, "but why not look at last night in a positive way. You should be pleased that your Hannah was rejecting this yentzer's advances."

"Ha," says Hetty, "I can see from your face that you don't believe me. But I'm really sincere, doctor. I always tell the truth."

"OK Hetty, I believe you," says doctor Simon. "But I didn't jump for joy because I'm just not used to getting compliments."

"You don't get any compliments, doctor, because you're a khozzer," says Hetty, "and you're completely overweight as a result. But as I've just told you, you're nevertheless a handsome khozzer."

### #2236 Help not needed

[My thanks to Ron L for the following]

"Mummy," asks little Paul, "why do some children celebrate Christmas and not Chanukah?"

Rivkah thinks that this is a very reasonable question for a little boy to ask, so she tells Paul about the Christmas story. "Christmas started a long time ago  ...  Joseph and Mary  ...  travelling all way to Bethlehem  ...  sheep and donkeys  ...  going through pregnancy ...   the shed  ...  Jesus is born  ...  laid in manger  ...  angels and shepherds and wise men  ...  many others bringing gifts and food.  In fact there were so many people, so many animals, so many things happening at the same time, that between you and me Paul, if it had been me, I would have hired a nanny and a caterer to help me out with such an important affair."

90 year old Shmuel is at the end of his life. He's in a hospital bed with his 60 year old wife Becky sitting in a chair next to his bed. Suddenly, Shmuel opens his eyes and quietly says to her, "Becky, you know I'm going to die soon?"

"Yes, darling," she replies quietly, "I know that."

"Well then," continues Shmuel, "now's the time to be honest with me. Have you ever been unfaithful to me in all the time we've been married?"

After a lengthy silence, Becky replies, "Oy, Shmuel. I just don't understand your question."

"Becky," says Shmuel, "you can tell me the truth now. I'm dying. I can take it. Did you ever make love to other men whilst we were married?"

But Becky just sits there in silence.

"What's the problem?" asks Shmuel.

"I'm worried," replies Becky. "Suppose I tell you and you don't die?"

### #2238 Perfection, you're not

Bernie and his wife Renee have to wait many years before their third and last child eventually marries and moves out. As they are now in their fifties and living in a large house, they decide to downsize. Renee immediately starts looking for a suitable apartment to buy. Two weeks later, she is convinced that she has found the ideal apartment and takes Bernie to view it.

When they get back home, Renee says, "Well, wasn't I right Bernie? Isn't it just perfect for us? It's a place for us to kvell in."

But Bernie replies, "Sorry Renee, but I don't agree with you. I just don't like it."

"Why, what's wrong with it?" asks Renee.

"I don't like what they call the feature bathroom," replies Bernie. "The designer must have been a bit tsedudelt. If you want me to be more specific, the very large bathroom window goes right down almost to floor level, yet it has no provision for any curtains. It would cost us a lot of money to have builders replace it with a more normal window, money we don't have after paying for our third daughter's wedding."

"So why replace it?" asks Renee. "It's a fun window."

"Fun?" says Bernie. "You must be joking. When I take a bath, the neighbours opposite would be able to clearly see me naked, and that's not fun," replies Bernie.

"Well If it's your private parts you're worried about Bernie," says Renee, "I shouldn't worry. You're nothing special down there. And once the neighbours have seen you in your full glory and finished being sick, they will almost certainly give us the money to have the large pictorial window replaced with a more conventional curtained one."



kvell: gush with pride and glow with pleasure

tsedudelt: wacky, crazy

### #2239 Sarah's week at the gym

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Dear Diary, I'm 45 years old today, kin-a-hora. Even though I think I'm still in good shape from all the walking I do, I've decided that for my birthday, I'm going to purchase 5 days with a personal trainer at my local gym. I've always wanted to give it a try. But dad thinks I must be meshugga to try. He said, "You've got no saychel. Anyone who wants to work out in a gym has a loch in kop."  Nevertheless, I made a reservation with a personal trainer named Barry. He told me over the phone that he was 23 years old, has been an aerobics instructor for over two years, and also models for a Jewish swimwear company.



And he is even Jewish!. Oy vey, what mazel.



MONDAY:

I began my workout at 6am.  Although it was difficult to get out of bed so early, Barry said I should. When I arrived at the gym, I found it was well worth the while. Not only is Barry a ying mit bainer, he's also got lovely blond hair, beautiful hypnotic eyes, an absolutely dazzling smile, and a great toches. He started by giving me a tour of the gym and explaining all the machines. He then focused on some basic training and was very encouraging as I did my sit-ups, even though my stomach was aching from holding it in every time he came near me. Before I left for the day, I enjoyed watching the skilful way in which he conducted his aerobics class.



This is going to be a special week for me. My friends said it was bashayrt.



TUESDAY:

I was very tired when I woke up and had to drink three cups coffee to help clear my head. Eventually, I made it out of the door. As soon as I arrived at the gym, Barry told me to lie down on my back. He then gave me an iron bar and immediately put some heavy weights on it. He then told me to push the loaded bar up and down in the air. What a chutzpah! I had never done this before and after doing this lifting up and down for some time, oy, was I shvitzing! Then, without letting me get my breath back, he put me on one of the treadmills and ran it at slow speed. I was hoping it would develop a glitch. But no such luck. I actually ran 1 mile and when I got off, my legs felt like jelly. Even though I was very tired, I still thought it worth while because of the lovely, sexy smile Barry gave me when I left.



I feel very pleased with my self. A whole new life is opening up for me.



WEDNESDAY:

I woke up very tired again and my arms ached so much that I couldn't brush my teeth. Driving to the gym that morning was very difficult. It was OK as long as I didn't try to turn the steering wheel too quickly or brake too suddenly. What a shlep it was to get to the gym. Soon after I arrived, as if my painful body wasn't enough, Barry got broyges with me because he said my kvitching was bothering other members. And I noticed that when he scolds, his voice turns into a nasally whine. I almost gave him a klop where it would hurt him most but changed my mind at the last moment. What a k'nocker he's becoming.  My chest hurt when I got on the treadmill, so Barry took me off and instead put me on the stair monster. Why would someone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? Barry told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life better. He said some other drek too. I ended up totally oysgemitchet.



What a shluff I'm going to have tonight.



THURSDAY:

I was half an hour late because it took me that long to tie my shoes. And to make it worse, the groisser potz was waiting for me with his teeth exposed and cruel lips pulled back in a full snarl. He took me to work out with dumbbells. But then, when he was not looking, I ran and hid in the restroom. But he found me and as punishment, he put me on the rowing machine for 40 minutes. I got very broyges with him.



I hate Barry more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world.



FRIDAY:

Barry put me on the treadmill again, but this time he put it on high speed. And oy gevalt, it immediately flung me off. But I wasn't having any glick at all because I landed on another club member, not on Barry. I was so shocked by this that I immediately pishen in my pants and let rip with a fortz.  But then a miracle happened - when I got up, I suddenly saw the light. What mishegass it was for me to have decided I needed to go to a gym. What a shmo I had been. If I continued to go, I would be in shtook with my body. So I quickly came to a decision. "Zol es brennen," I said to myself, "I don't need some farcockteh putz of a trainer to make me happy. Er zol einemen a meeseh meshuneh.



If I never see the inside of a gym again, then nebbech.



SATURDAY:

I couldn't move any part of my body this morning without some pain, so I had to go to my shul by car. It was the only way I was able to get there. I  prayed that next year my husband will choose a gift for me that is real fun - like root canal treatment. I now tell everybody that if God had wanted me to bend over in a gym, he would have sprinkled the floor with diamonds!  And then everyone would see me kvell.

### #2240 A watery grave

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Sophie meets her friend Emma in Brent Cross shopping centre. "So, Emma," she says, "I hear that you and your husband Adam are having some problems."

"Yes, that's true Sophie," replies Emma.

"And I also hear that your problems are all to do with your Adam's lack of love making skills."

"Yes, that's correct," says Emma, looking a bit embarrassed.

"Oy, Emma," says Sophie, "I'm so sorry to hear this. But if I may make a suggestion, I've heard that using a water bed can make a vast difference to arousal levels. Maybe you should buy such a bed. It would probably feel like you're making love on water."

"You're joking," replies Emma. "With my Adam, it would feel like a cruise on the Dead Sea."

### #2241 Speed is of the essence

[My thanks to Asher for the following]

After many years of hard work, Sheldon and his wife Yetta at last begin to make serious money from their shmatta business. So much so that they celebrate their success by buying a brand new Bentley.

On their second day of car ownership, Sheldon says to Yetta, "Darling, why don't you take the day off from the office and take the car on a short spin on the M1 Motorway? You'll just love it."

Yetta doesn't need asking twice. One hour later, she's cruising at 70mph on the M1.

"Sheldon was right," says Yetta to herself. "This car is absolute perfection. It's a mecheiyeh."

Soon, forgetting all about speed limits, she is travelling at over 100mph. And she's absolutely kvelling as she increases her speed to 115mph, and then to 130mph and then ............ Oy vey, she sees a police car in the distance coming up to her with its lights flashing. Fortunately for Yetta, she's very close to a Motorway Service Station, so she quickly pulls off the M1, drives up to McDonalds, gets out of the Bentley and runs  into the ladies toilets. She finds a vacant cubicle, goes in, lifts up her dress, pulls down her knickers, and sits down on the toilet. Within seconds, two policewomen enter the ladies toilets, and one of them shouts, "Will the owner of the silver Bentley parked outside please unlock their cubicle door at once."

Yetta does what she's asked to do and sits down again. Almost immediately, the door opens wide and there, standing in front of her, are two policewomen.

"So nu ladies?" says Yettya, smiling. "It's so nice of you both to check up on my predicament. I suppose you both thought I wouldn't get here in time? But zorg zich nit. I made it."



shmatta: a rag, A shmatta business is usually a clothing shop

mecheiyeh: a pleasure

kvelling: gushing with pride

zorg zich nit: Don't you worry about it

### #2242 A true marriage partnership

One Sunday, two separate wedding ceremonies take place in Bushey shul. First of all, Mervyn gets married to Lisa from Golders Green, and then later in the afternoon, Aaron gets married to Hannah from Israel. So, you might ask, did both their marriages start on a positive note?

Well, on his first day of married life, Mervyn says to Lisa, "You'll always have to do all the house cleaning, all the cooking, and all the washing and drying up of crockery on your own. That's what my mother always did, and that's what I will expect you to do from now onwards. And I'll try to help you whenever I can."

On his second day of married life, Mervyn doesn't notice anything different, but on his third day, Mervyn is pleased to see that Lisa is at last following his instructions.

So what about Aaron and Hannah? Well, on their first day of married life, Aaron says to Hannah, "You'll have to do all the house cleaning, all the washing and drying up of crockery, all the shopping, and all the cooking on your own. You'll also have to have my dinner ready on the table the minute I arrive back from work. And once a fortnight, you'll also have to mow the lawn and clean the outside of the windows. That's what my mother always did, and that's what I will expect you to do from now onwards. And don't expect much help from me - I'll be too busy doing my own things."

On his second day of married life, Aaron doesn't see any results. And on his third day, Aaron doesn't see any results. But by his fourth day, some of the swelling on his face has gone down and Aaron can see a little out of his left eye. And his right arm has healed enough to allow him to fix himself a sandwich, load the dishwasher and mow the lawn. But he still has some difficulty urinating.

### #2243  You can't fool me

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Shlomo and his wife Leah have two lovely twin boys called Daniel and Lionel. But as the twins grow up, they start to develop quite different personalities - Daniel becomes more and more pessimistic whereas Lionel becomes more and more optimistic. His boys' behaviour starts to worry Shlomo so much that he asks for help from Dr. David, a psychiatrist friend of his.

After hearing his story, Dr. David says to Daniel. "It's a common problem with twins, Daniel. But don't worry - we have a tried and tested method of smoothing out your boys differences. Here's what you must do. Buy Daniel some absolutely fantastic toys. Buy lots of them, and ensure that they are the very latest in the marketplace."

"Is that all I have to do?" asks Shlomo.

"No, of course not," replies Dr. David. "At the same time you buy Daniel his wonder toys, you must go to your local farm and buy bags and bags of freshly deposited horse manure. It must be fresh and smelly. Then, at exactly the same time you give Daniel his great presents, you must spread the manure all over Lionel's bedroom floor. In this way, you will be able to see the boys' differences quickly minimise."

"Thank you Dr. David," says Shlomo. "I'm going to take tomorrow off and get everything you have suggested in time for when my boys return from school."

Next afternoon, when the boys return from school and go to their bedrooms, Shlomo and Leah wait in anticipation. But after 10 minutes, they hear nothing so decide to go see what is happening. First they go into Daniel's room. And there is Daniel crying his eyes out with all his great toys around him.

"Why are you crying, Daniel?" says Shlomo. "Aren't you happy with the fantastic toys we got you?"

"They're OK, I guess," replies Daniel, "but I know that Lionel has got a much better present."

So Shlomo and Leah go into Lionel's bedroom. And there is Lionel, with the largest and widest smile on his face, on his hands and knees on the manure filled floor, looking for something under the manure.

"What are you doing, Lionel?" asks Hannah.

Lionel stops his searching for a moment, looks up, and says, "Oh hello Mum, hello Dad. I just want to say thanks for my terrific present."

Lionel and Leah look at each other in amazement. "What present are you talking about, Lionel?" asks Shlomo.

"It's no use, Dad," replies Lionel. "You can't fool me. Where there's manure, there must be a pony!"

### #2244 The best teacher there is

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Today is a special day - it's Fay and Maurice's Silver Wedding anniversary, and to celebrate, they've organised a party for family and friends.

During the evening, Maurice gives a short speech on how he met Fay. But just as he is about to sit down, one of his closest friends shouts out, "Maurice, we all now know about bus, car, air and rail travel in those far off days. But what we would also like to know is this - what specifically have you learned from all your wonderful years with Fay?"

"That's an easy question to answer," replies Maurice. "From living with Fay, I've learned why it's important to be meek and not bossy; I've learned how to ask for forgiveness; I've learned the importance of being patient; I've learned self-restraint and how to maintain self-control; I've learned to recognise who my superior is; I've learned never to interrupt; and I've learned the importance of loyalty. In fact, I've learned many, many qualities that I would never have thought I needed had I stayed single. Fay is a wonderful teacher."

### #2245 18 months of study

Although Michael is a Christian, he has lots of Jewish friends. One day, he wakes up and declares to himself, "That's it! I'm going to convert to Judaism." Later that day, he's told by all his friends that a proper, formal conversion takes years of study. But he's made up his mind and so embarks on his conversion study. And for the next 18 months, he studies Judaism continuously from morning till night. Finally, he feels that he's ready to apply to take the test and so complete his conversion to Judaism. He's very, very excited.

His conversion test day soon arrives and he goes to the appointed place where he is met by a rabbi. "Shalom aleichem," says the rabbi.

"Aleichem shalom," replies Michael.

"OK," says the rabbi, "before we begin, I must inform you that my fee this morning for the 3 hours I shall be conducting the conversion test will be £400. Is this acceptable to you?"

"£400 is really a lot of money for me at this time, rabbi," replies Michael. "How about £250? I can give this to you in cash."

"Mazeltov," says the rabbi, "you've passed the conversion test."



shalom aleichem: 'peace unto you,' a traditional greeting of Jews.

aleichem shalom: the traditional response to 'shalom aleichem.'

mazeltov: congratulations.

### #2246 How the Internet started

[My thanks to Tony L and John B (separately) for the following]

You might have thought that you knew how the Internet started, but here is  the true story.

In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot.

And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.

Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.

And she said unto Abraham, her husband, "Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?"

And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, "How, dear?"

And Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns, and drums in between, to send messages saying what you have for sale. And they will reply telling you who hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."

Abraham thought long and hard and decided that he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And soon the drums rang out and were an immediate success. So Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.

Later, to prevent neighbouring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was called Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS). And she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures called Hebrew To The People (HTTP).

But Abraham's success did soon arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and began to siphon off some of Abraham's business. But he was soon discovered, arrested and prosecuted - for insider trading.

Soon after, the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.

And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. And he did insist on drums being made that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.

And Dot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."

And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known, he said, "We need a name that reflects what we are."

And Dot replied, How about "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators." "Yahoo," said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.

Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). And that's how the Internet began.

### #2247 Conversation at a market

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Sophie has been going through some hard times of recent and has to buy food as cheaply as she possibly can. Today she's walked to a local market to negotiate  for some low-priced fish. She's quite knowledgeable about fish, so she goes over to one of the fish stalls and starts to check out the fish on offer, and the prices. After a few minutes of looking at the fish, prodding the fish, and checking the prices, she goes over to the lady owner of the stall and asks, "I've just been checking out your fish on display and I need to ask you a few questions."

"So fire away, already," says the lady owner.

"OK," says Sophie, "Is your  grey mullet still fresh?"

"Of course," replies the stallholder.

"And is it still alive?" asks Sophie.

"No, I'm afraid it has recently died," replies the stallholder solemnly.

"I thought that might be the case," says Sophie. "It explains why you are charging so much for it."

"What do you mean?" asks the stallholder.

"Well I was surprised by the high price you're asking for it, and thought you must be collecting some money to cover the cost of the fish's funeral."

"What's the matter Sidney?" asks Moshe, "you're looking a bit agitated."

"It's probably because I've just learned that my wife Talia has run off with my best friend," replies Sidney.

"Oy vey," says Moshe, "I'm sorry to hear this. But how could your best friend do this to you? And who is he, this best friend of yours?"

"I've absolutely no idea who he is," replies Sidney. "But he's certainly my best friend now."

### #2250 Mid life crisis

50 year old Fay is talking to her best friend. "I think I've reached that mystical thing, Rose, they call the mid-life crisis."

"Why do you say that?" asks Rose."

"Because I was talking to my son Paul the other day and he just didn't seem to be listening to me. All he seemed to be doing was concentrating on his precious J-phone, or is it an I-phone, I don't know? He was continuously staring at the phone's screen, pressing one part of the screen after another, talking to himself, and fiddling with various buttons. I just couldn't get him to look up at me. It was just as if I didn't exist. And it was then that I said to myself, "And for this, Fay, it was worth getting stretch marks for?

### #2252 A question for the rabbi

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Moshe goes to see his rabbi and asks, "Rebe, if you had a choice between having five million pounds or five lovely daughters, what would you choose?"

Without a second's hesitation, the rabbi replies, "That's an easy question, Moshe, I'd choose five daughters."

"So Rebe, why would you choose having five daughters?" asks Moshe.

"That's an easy choice for me, Moshe," replies the rabbi, "I already have eight daughters.

### #2253 Conversation on a tube train

Jeremy is not liked by most of his fellow students. They call him 'the scourge of the elderly' because he's always looking for opportunities to start a conversation with someone with grey hair so that he can end up ridiculing him. Today, Jeremy is on a tube train and next to him is David, a senior citizen with thick white hair. Jeremy looks at David and says, "excuse me for pointing this out, but I find it impossible for my generation to understand your generation."

"So what seems to be the problem?" asks David.

"Well," replies Jeremy in a voice loud enough so that everyone nearby can hear, "your generation obviously grew up in a totally different world to the one we live in today. Today we live in a world of computers, the internet, smart phones, wind farms, nuclear power, 200mph racing cars, satellite television,  3D films, superfast passenger planes, space travel, hybrid cars, medicines to cure almost any disease, and ....."

At this point, David interrupts and angrily and loudly says, "You're absolutely right, sonny boy. When I was younger, we certainly didn't have all those things you've just mentioned. So guess what we did? We invented them, you little schmuck! So please tell me, just what are you lot doing for the next generation?"

At this, a great cheer goes up from the other passengers.

### #2254 My new girlfriend

[My thanks to Emmanuel for the following]

During a regular early morning shul service, Rabbi Levy couldn't help noticing 21 year old Benny sitting at the back of the shul looking very sad. He had his head in his hands. So at a convenient moment, Rabbi Levy goes over to him and asks, "What's wrong, Benny? Tell me. Maybe I can help."

"Oh rabbi," replies Benny, "I just don't know what to do for the best. Every time I bring a new girlfriend to my house and introduce her to my parents, no matter how wonderful the girl is, my mother always tells me that she does not like her at all."

"I've heard this story many times before," says Rabbi Levy, "but you'll be pleased to hear that I have a tried and tested solution for you. Next time you choose a girlfriend, make sure she not only looks just like your mother, but also talks like your mother, laughs like your mother, cooks like your mother, and dresses like your mother. Believe me, Benny, if you find such a girl, your mother will absolutely love her."

Many weeks go by before Benny finds someone just like his mother. And not only that, but the girl very quickly falls madly in love with him. So Benny invites her to meet his parents and this time is feeling very optimistic that all will go well."

At the next shul service, Rabbi Levy notices that Benny is once again sitting at the back of the shul looking unbelievably unhappy. So once again, during a break in the service, Rabbi Levy goes over to Benny. "What's wrong Benny?" asks Rabbi Levy. "Couldn't you find someone like your mother?"

"Rabbi," replies Benny, "miraculously, I found a girl just like my mum. Not only did she look just like mum, but she also talked like mum, laughed like mum, cooked like mum, and dressed like mum."

"So everything should have worked out OK for you," says Rabbi Levy.

"No, rabbi, it didn't," replies Benny. "My father didn't like her."

### #2257 An exchange of gifts

The very attractive and sparsely dressed Shula gets on the 8am bus going to Jerusalem. It's a popular bus with the Chassidim, and it's almost full when she gets on. She looks around for a seat and can only find one next to a Chassid. So she walks over to the seat and sits down. However, her short dress totally embarrasses the Chassid, so much so that he begins to squirm. Then, five minutes into the journey, as the Chassid gets up to leave the bus, he takes an apple out of his bag and hands it to her.

"What's this for?" Shula asks the Chassid. "Why did you give me this apple?"

"I gave it to you," replies the Chassid, "because it says in the bible that Eve didn't realise she was naked until she ate the apple."

The next morning, Shula dresses in a more sensible way, and gets on the same bus to Jerusalem. And she sits again next to the Chassid. Immediately she hands him an apple.

The Chassid looks very closely at the apple, then asks her, "What is this? What have you given me?"

"I've given you an apple," replies Shula.

"So why have you given me an apple?" asks the Chassid.

"Because," replies Shula, "until Adam ate the apple, he didn't know he had to work for a living."

### #2258 Is it really an over-eating problem?

Sarah meets her friend Hetty at Brent Cross shopping centre. "Hello Hetty," says Sarah, "how are things going with you? Last time we met, you told me that you were very unhappy because you were gaining weight and didn't know what to do about it?"

"Oy, that's true Sarah," replies Hetty, "but the good news is that although I'm still gaining weight, I have found a solution to my problem."

"So tell me what it is already," says Sarah.

"Well," says Hetty, "I found a guru who told me that my main problem was not my gaining of weight, but my being unhappy. And so he has been focussing on helping me to look on the bright side of things."

"So how do you now feel about everything?" asks Sarah.

"Well, I had originally thought of joining an aerobics class, but as a result of my guru's help, I now laugh every time I think about aerobics. All I do is say to myself, 'Every 10 minutes of every day, someone pulls a muscle in an aerobics class,' and I laugh. And that's not all. I now also firmly believe that my weight gain is not caused by food, but by the ever-increasing amount of information I'm having to store in my head as I get older.

### #2259 Jewish Logic (an old Russian story)

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Three men get onto a train going to Moscow. One is a Russian orthodox batyushka, one is a Roman Catholic Priest, and the other is a Rabbi.

These three religious men end up sitting next to each other on the train and because they are bored, very soon out comes a pack of cards and they start playing.  But quite soon after, they hear the loud voice of a policeman in the compartment immediately next to theirs shouting, "You're playing cards. You know it's forbidden to play cards here. You must pay me a fine right now."

The three realise they only have only a short time before the policeman comes into their compartment, so they quickly push all the cards onto the floor by their feet. When the policeman comes into their compartment, the three religious men are looking very calm, serene, and virtuous.

As soon as the policeman sees all the cards on the floor by their feet, he says to them, "I'm surprised to find you three religious men playing cards. You know this is illegal and it's setting a bad example to all here."

On hearing this, the batyushka says to the policeman "but sir, we are not playing cards. We wouldn't do such a thing."

"So give me your word of honour that you weren't playing cards," says the policeman.

"I swear by the sweet name of Jesus that I didn't play cards," replies the batyushka.

The policeman cannot object to these solemn words and has to accept them. He then looks at the Catholic Priest and says, "And you? Please give me your word of honour that you were not playing cards."

"I swear by the sweet name of the Virgin Mary that I didn't play cards," replies the Catholic priest.

As before, the policeman cannot object to these solemn words and has to accept them. He then slowly looks at the Rabbi and with a wicked grin says, "So it must have been you playing cards, eh Rabbi?"

"Me? Playing cards?" says the rabbi. "This might be possible, but with whom?"

### #2260 Cut down on everything

Morris, not the brightest of men, is getting older. He has just turned 70 and is beginning to moan regularly about all his aches and pains. So much so that he is driving his Sarah crazy. One morning, she angrily says to him, "I've had enough already with hearing about all your pains, Morris. I keep on telling you - go see a doctor."

To her surprise, Morris at last makes an appointment and goes to see Dr. Levy.

When he returns, Sarah says, "So nu? Tell me what the doctor said already."

"Well after checking me over," replies Morris, "he said that for a man of my age, I was in pretty good condition."

"Mazeltov," says Sarah. "Is that all he said?"

"No, that wasn't all," replies Morris. "He also said that I had a small heart condition."

"Oy veh Morris," cries Sarah, "I knew it. You're going to die. What'll I do? Where's my money going to come from? How am....."

At that, Morris interrupts and says, "Shush, Sarah. Don't panic. Dr. Levy said I was going to be OK as long as I cut down a little on everything. Especially on things such as drinking, eating, arguing, and the like.

"Well that should be easy for you to do," says Sarah. "I'll help you to cut down on these things."

"But that wasn't all Dr. Levy said," continues Morris. "He said I should also cut down on love making. He said that for a man of 70, semi-annually should be enough. So tell me, Sarah, How many times a week is semi-annually?"

"Oy!" says the shadchen. "So didn't your date with her go well?"

"Going well had nothing to do with it," replies Isaac. "I trusted you to find me a girl who closely matched all my needs."

"I thought I had," says the shadchen. "You asked for someone with beauty, intelligence and a love of music. Someone brought up in a well-respected family. Am I correct?"

"Yes, that's correct," replies Isaac.

"So wasn't she as beautiful as I said she was?" asks the shadchen.

"Yes," replies Isaac, "she was very beautiful indeed."

"And wasn't she as intelligent as I said she was?" asks the shadchen.

"Yes," replies Isaac, "she was very clever indeed."

"And wasn't she a brilliant pianist as I said she was?" asks the shadchen.

"Yes," replies Isaac, "she played Chopin exceedingly well."

"So what's the problem, then?" asks the shadchen. "I'm confused."

"My problem," replies Isaac, "is all to do with the well-respected family requirement. You told me that her father was no longer alive. But I discovered that this is not true. He has been in jail for the past 5 years for fraud."

"Nu? So did I lie to you?" says the shadchen. "Surely you wouldn't call that living?"

4 year old Gary goes to the toilet to pishen. But while in there, he doesn't concentrate on what he is doing and somehow lets the toilet seat slam down on his petseleh. He instantly screams out in pain and runs to his mother Sarah, crying out loudly.

When Sarah hears what has happened, she hugs and kisses Gary and says to him, "Oh my poor little bubbeleh."

"Oh mummy, mummy," sobs Gary, "please make it well again ... please kiss it better for me ... oh please, please kiss it better ... I'll love you for ever if you do."

With a deep sigh,  Sarah replies, "Oy veh! you sound more and more like your father every day."



pishen: urinate

petseleh: little penis

### #2266 Good marriage advice

Morris is giving some advice to his newly married son. "David," he says, "my one piece of advice to you is this: as you go through life with Sarah, never ever criticize her faults."

"Why do you say this, Dad?" asks David.

"Because it might have been these faults of hers, these little imperfections, that luckily for you prevented her from getting a better husband."

### #2267 Friendly advice

Isaac meets his friend Arnold and can't help noticing how tired he looks. "Arnold," he says, "I hope nothing is wrong with you - you look, please excuse me for saying so, you look a bit of a wreck. Is anything the matter? Can I be of help?"

"It doesn't surprise me at all, Isaac," replies Arnold. "I haven't had a good night's sleep for months."

"Oy veh, Arnold," says Isaac, "that's not at all good. You must try to relax more. And not only that. You must never, ever take your troubles to bed with you."

"I couldn't agree with you more," says Arnold. "But unfortunately, I can't do anything about it. Mine Rachel refuses to sleep on her own."

### #2268 How to separate

[My thanks to Alex S for the following]

Moshe remarries, but as the years roll by, he feels less and less happy about his marriage to Golda. Then one day, while they are having breakfast, Moshe plucks up enough courage to say to her, "Golda, I really can’t see much point in continuing with this marriage of ours. We are always arguing and I'm suffering a lot of stress as a result. Let's call it a day and get divorced."

“No, no, no," shouts Golda, "absolutely, 100% not. I was a widow when I decided to marry you, and the only way I will agree to leave you is by becoming a widow again."

### #2269 The special birthday present

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

It will soon be her grandson Paul's 8th birthday and Hetty decides to go to Hamleys, the world's largest toy shop, to buy him a suitable present. But two hours after entering the shop, and after seeing what seems like thousands of toys, games, construction sets and items of electronic equipment, Hetty has still not found what she believes to be the perfect present for her Paul.

"Madam," says her salesman, wearily, "how about an exciting video? Or what about an educational game?"

"No, they're not really what I'm looking for," replies Hetty.

So they continue to wander up and down the aisles, floor after floor, looking for the right present. Then, at last, Hetty sees something that she's certain will meet her needs. It's a large scale battle tank with a noisy high pitched electric engine, laser guns that emit explosive sounds, bright flashing lights when the tank is played with in the dark, and six soldiers inside the tank, each of which loudly shouts out various instructions, warnings, cries for help, etc.

"That's it!" Hetty shouts out with a wide smile on her face. "That's it! That's the perfect present for my bubbeleh Paul."

"How do you know that?" asks the salesman.

"Because not only will it give naches to my boychick Paul," replies Hetty, "but also, my daughter-in-law Carolyn will be broyges and will hate the toy to bits."



bubbeleh: term of endearment

naches: pride, pleasure, good fortune

boychick: young boy, bit of a lad

broyges: angry



END OF THIS MONTH'S NEW JOKES

Dear reader,

The following are not Jewish jokes, so you don't have to read any further.

But if you are willing to read on, I would like to tell you two stories relating to holiday events that actually happened to my wife and I over the last 20 years or so.

I hope you will find them amusing (but you don't have to!)

Event#1:

Our plane had just landed at London Gatwick airport and was slowly taxiing towards its arrival Gate. As our hand luggage was in an overhead locker two rows behind me, I decided to be ready to get up and retrieve our hand luggage as soon as the plane had stopped and before the hordes of passengers on nearby seats all got up and converged around me. Clever me!

So as soon as the plane stopped at its gate, but before the plane had shut down its engines, I quickly undid my seat belt and got up. No one else had yet got up because the seat belt sign had not yet been turned off. But then suddenly, the plane lurched forward a very, very tiny bit, but it was enough to cause me to severely struggle to keep my balance. All those seated around me, including a stewardess, saw how I nearly fell over. The stewardess immediately got onto the Tannoy and announced to the whole of the plane, "Did you see what just happened to that gentleman? That's exactly why we ask you all to stay in your seats until the engines are switched off and the seat belt buckle sign is switched off."

Oy, was I embarrassed! And I have never repeated this stupid action.

Event#2:

Then there was the time my wife and I were flying to Italy. We had been allocated the 2 seats near the window and we were wondering whether anyone was going to take the single aisle seat next to us. We thought we were going to have the three seats to ourselves, but then, right at the last moment, a very large Muslim lady wearing her full length white gown came waddling down the aisle towards us and we realised that she was going to be our companion on the flight. We had no trouble with this arrangement other than the fact that my wife and I like regularly getting out of our seats to stretch and exercise our legs in the aisle. Our companion, being so overweight, would probably not like having to get up regularly to let us out. So quick as a flash, I put on my best smile and asked her whether she would like the window seat. To our surprise she said she would love it. So we exchanged seats and our 'problem' was solved.

But we forgot something which caused all three of us to burst out laughing. When our in-flight meals were being served, the stewardess came to our row, leaned over to our companion in the window seat and said to her, "Here you are madam, here is the kosher meal you ordered." I had forgotten that my wife and I had ordered kosher meals for this flight. And the stewardess did not know that we had altered our seating arrangements. Oy, was I amused!

I'm also pleased to say that this lovely Muslim lady and my wife and I got on very well together for the rest of the journey and we were almost sorry when it was time to say goodbye.

### #2280 Money problems

Morris and Daniel, two up and coming authors, were always bragging how well each was doing. They meet up again at Jewish Book Week and Morris says, "So nu, Daniel, how are you doing? Are your books selling well?"

"Oh yes Morris, they definitely are," replies Daniel, boasting. "Since we last met, the number of my readers has doubled."

"Mazeltov Daniel," says Morris. "You didn't tell me that you got married!"

### #2281 The best idea

As they are leaving shul, Cyril says to his friend Avrahom, "Why are you looking so farmisht? Is anything wrong?"

"Is anything right? you might have asked," replies Avrahom. "My business is in a terrible state and I owe a hell of a lot of money.  (pause)  And I don't have the slightest idea where I'm going to get it from."

"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that," says Cyril.

"Why do you say that?" says Avrahom, "I thought we were friends."

"We are," says Cyril, "I only said it because for one moment, I thought you might have had the idea of asking me to lend you the money."



farmisht: confused, mixed up, befuddled

### #2282 The inventory

[My thanks to Rachel for the following]

Morris comes home early from work one day, goes into the bedroom, and finds his wife Hetty lying totally naked on the bed.

"Oy vey, Hetty, what on earth are you doing?" he asks.

"I've been trying on a few of my dresses," replies Hetty, "and I can't find any that I like. I just don't have as many outfits as my friends do."

"You're meshugga, Hetty," says Morris. "How can you say that when you have more outfits in your wardrobe than you can possibly need. Let me remind you what you have."

Morris goes over to Hetty's wardrobe, opens up the doors, and pointing at each outfit in turn, says, "In your wardrobe you have a green outfit, a red outfit, a shabbes outfit, Mr Schwartz from next door, a grey outfit, a yom tov outfit, a rose coloured outfit, a ........."



meshugga: mad, crazy

shabbes: Sabbath

yom tov: Jewish holiday

### #2283 Classroom etiquette

[My thanks to Jurgen M for the following]

Kirstin the teacher wants to find out how many of her 9-10 year old pupils, with their families, are religious enough to say prayers in their own house. So one day she asks the question to everyone in her class in turn. But when she gets to Aaron, who is her sole Jewish pupil, she asks him in a more gentle way.

"So Aaron," she asks, "what do you do as soon as you sit down for dinner at home?"

"Nu? So what should I do miss?" replies Aaron. "I eat of course. That's what I do."

"And your parents, Aaron?" continues Kirstin. "What do they do as soon as they sit down for dinner?"

"It's obvious, isn't it miss?" replies Kirstin. "They also start to eat."

"And when you have finished your meal, Aaron, what do you then do?" asks Kirstin.

"I quickly get up and play games on my computer miss" replies Aaron.

"And what about your parents, Aaron? What do they then do?" asks Kirstin.

"Nu? So what should they do miss?" replies Aaron. "They also get up from the table, and while my mum washes up, my dad turns on the TV."

"And what do you do before you go to sleep, Aaron?" asks Kirstin.

"I turn onto my side and then I quickly fall asleep miss," replies Aaron.

"And  what about your parents, Aaron?" asks Kirstin. "What do they do before they go to sleep?"

"Oy vey? Must I really tell you this miss?" replies Aaron. "I know what they do, and you probably know what they do. But is this something for all the class to hear?"

### #2284 The reckoning

Early one morning, as Patrick and Christopher are walking past the Great Portland Street Shul, Patrick says, "So how many people do you think are in this large synagogue, Christopher?"

"There are exactly nine hundred and ninetynine thousand, nine hundred and ninetynine people in the synagogue," replies Christopher.

"Wow! " says Patrick. "How on earth did you know that?"

"Because yesterday morning," replies Christopher, "I heard one of them come out and say to a passer-by that they are one short of a milyan."

### #2285 Disaster strikes twice

Oy vey! THE SEA MINKY, a kosher cruise liner, is suddenly hit by a hurricane out at sea and is shipwrecked on an island inhabited by cannibals. Only three passengers manage to survive the shipwreck and they just happen to be members of the same shul - Rabbi Levy, Morris the shul's President and Lazarus the shul's chazan. They are pulled out from the wreck and brought before the leader of the cannibals.

"We are looking forward to eating the three of you," says the leader, "but before we do, it is our custom to grant you a last request. So could each of you tell me in turn what you would like to do before you die."

Lazarus the chazan considers for a few minutes, then replies, "I love singing and there’s a special composition that I’ve always wanted to perform. But because it takes 15 minutes, I’ve never been given permission to sing it in my synagogue. I would like to sing it here, before I die."

"Granted," says the leader.

Rabbi Levy then says, "I love giving sermons but I have never been given permission to give my magnum opus sermon to my synagogue's congregation. I've been working on it for years but I've not been allowed to give it because it could take up to two hours to do it justice. So I’d like to give this sermon here, before I die."

"OK, granted," says the leader. He then turns to Morris the President and says, "And what about you? What do you want?"

Morris the President immediately replies, "Please could you eat me first."



Magnum opus: from the Latin meaning "great work" refers to the largest achievement of a writer, artist, or composer (or in this case, a rabbi). It doesn't have to be the greatest or most successful work of that person, just a work on a large scale.

### #2286 True story?

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

A New York Governor invites a group of clergy to the State House on a Friday for breakfast. However, as soon as they all are seated and the food is delivered to the table, he begins to wonder whether he has made a faux pas by serving meat on a Friday.

"Please do not worry, Governor," says the Catholic priest. "Vatican II took care of that."

But the same couldn't be said by the Jewish representative. Looking down at the large portion of bacon on his plate, Rabbi Levy says to the Governor, "I’m sorry, Governor, but I can't eat this - we are still operating under Sinai I."



Vatican II: The Second Vatican Council (also known as Vatican II) addressed relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the modern world.

### #2288 The first night

Moshe has just spent his first night at the expensive MINKY hotel. As soon as he awakes, he phones the hotel's reception desk.

"So how are you on this lovely morning, Mr Schwartz?" asks the receptionist.

"If you must know," replies Moshe, "I'm fuming. In fact I'm fuming so much that I'm ready to plotz,"

"Oh I'm sorry to hear that," says the receptionist. "So how can I help you?"

"I'm sure you've heard of the straw that broke the camel's back," replies Moshe.

"Of course I have," replies the receptionist.

"Well I've just spent the night sleeping on it!" says Moshe.



plotz: burst, explode, due to being very infuriated

### #2289 The way ahead

55 year old Arnold, a single man, has not been feeling too well for some time and so goes to see doctor Myers. After undergoing a few basic tests and some questioning on how he lives his life, Arnold says, "Well doctor, what do you think?"

"From what I can see from your test results Arnold," replies doctor Myers, "and from the answers you gave to my questions, you definitely need to make some significant changes to your lifestyle."

"Like what?" asks Arnold, looking a bit worried.

Doctor Myers replies, "Like giving up drinking all those glasses of kiddush wine and whiskey; like stopping all that putzing around you tell me you do most nights looking for women and excitement; like reducing all those roast beef and roast chicken meals you tell me you have most nights of the week; and like giving up smoking. Doing all this is the best way for you to improve your health and life expectancy. It's your number 1 course of action. What do you say?"

After taking some time to think about what he's just heard, Arnold replies, "And what's the second best course of action for me, doctor?"



putzing; to waste time, to sleep around, etc

"It's your business how hard I decide to hit Rosenberg?" replies the first man.

### #2292 What I love the most

[My thanks to Juergen for the following]

Jeremy, a teacher at the Minkofsky Jewish Free School, walks into his classroom one morning and says to his teenage pupils, "OK, listen up. Before we start our lesson proper, I'd like to ask you all an interesting question. What do you love the most in life? And if you have an answer, please put up your hand."

Immediately some hands go up.

"OK Morris," says Jeremy, "let's start with you. What is it that you most love in life?"

"I love my mameh and tateh most sir," replies Morris.

"That's a great reply, Morris," says Jeremy.

"And what about you Lionel?" asks Jeremy. "What do you love the most?"

"I love football most sir" replies Lionel.

"Thanks Lionel, that's a perfectly acceptable reply," says Jeremy. "And I will, of course, assume that you mean actually playing football rather than just watching it on TV."

"And you, Nathan, what about you?" asks Jeremy. "What do you love most?"

"Nu, if I'm honest teacher," replies Nathan, "I'd have to say that I would love a naked gezunta moyd most of all."

This unexpected reply makes the class laugh. But it shocks Jeremy so much that he immediately writes a letter to Nathan's father, puts the letter in an envelope, and hands it over to Nathan. "Please give this letter to your tateh," says Jeremy, "and tell him to sign it after he's finished reading it. Then return the signed letter to me tomorrow. Understood?"

"Yes, teacher," replies Nathan.

The following day, Nathan returns the signed letter to Jeremy.

"So Nathan, what did your father say after he read my letter?" asks Jeremy.

"Nu, if I'm honest teacher, my tateh and I discussed your letter for at least 30 minutes," replies Nathan. "We talked about it from many different viewpoints and then both of us came to the same conclusion."

"So tell me already," says Jeremy, "what was this conclusion? What did you both think?"

"We both thought that you must be gay, teacher," replies Nathan.



mameh: mother

tateh: father

gezunta moyd: a girl with a great body

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

She pushes Louis away and screams at him, "That's it. Go! Get out of this house right now. I can't stand the sight of you any more."

Louis was quite happy to obey and starts to walk towards the front door. But as he does so, she shouts at him, "and I hope you experience a long, slow and excruciatingly painful death."

Louis stops in his tracks, turns around, looks at Hannah and says, "Oy, make up your mind already. So now you want me to stay?"

### #2296 Only the best will do

Rachel has always lived in the poorer parts of London. But then she wins £15m on the national lottery. "At last," she says to herself, "I can now show everyone that I have a lot more class than they might otherwise have assumed."

Within weeks of her win, Rachel buys a £2m villa in Hampstead and starts planning for a big party where she will invite not only her wealthy neighbours, but also some leading celebrities of the day. Further, Rachel believes that it would be classy to have a famous opera singer at her party. But Rachel knows very little about Opera. So she visits the Minky Music Agency and tells the manager all about her forthcoming party at her new Villa and her need to have an opera singer there to entertain her important guests.

"So which Opera singer do you think I should have?" she asks the manager.

"I would recommend Joyce DiDonato," replies the Manager. "She will be the highlight of your party. And she has just arrived in the UK."

"So is she any good?" asks Rachel.

"What do you mean, is she any good?" replies the Manager. "She's one of the world's greatest virtuosos."

"I don't care what morals she has," says Rachel. "What I'm much more interested in is, 'can she sing?'"



Joyce DiDonato: Born February 13, 1969. she is an award-winning American operatic mezzo-soprano particularly admired for her interpretations of the works of Handel, Mozart, and Rossini. DiDonato has performed with many of the world's leading opera companies and orchestras. In 2012 she won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo.

"He's not very good, Freda," replies Benny. "Mervyn is getting quite demented. Whilst I was there, he screamed a lot and talked a load of mishegass."

"So were you able to talk to him at all?" asks Freda.

"Well," replies Benny, "I tried to talk simple things to him, things he should know something about, like the weather and whether he needed some extra clothes. I even asked him about the £500 he still owes me."

"And did he remember he still owed us this money?" asks Freda

"That meshugga he certainly isn't," replies Benny.



mishegass: madness, absurdity. The abstract noun from meshugga (q.v.)

meshugga: crazy, mad

### #2298 Isn't knowledge wonderful

[My thanks to BMS for the following]

Using a secure telephone connection, President Obama phones the Head of the CIA. "Answer me this question," he asks. "Our Jewish community always seems to find out everything that's going on here well before the US Administration does? How on earth can this be possible?"

The Head of the CIA replies, "I think I know why, Sir. The Jews have a Yiddish expression, 'vos hert zich?' which roughly translated means, What do you hear around? What's up? So a Jew merely has to ask another Jew, 'vos hert zich?' and listen to the reply. And that's how every Jew automatically knows everything that's going on."

Obama immediately decides to check this out. So with the help of his security department, he attaches a false beard, clothes himself in the garb of an Orthodox Jew, drives on his own to Brooklyn in a plain car, parks it, puts some coins in the meter, and then quickly walks to a nearby side street. There he sees an old Jewish man hobbling along with a stick. So Obama goes over to him and says, "Shalom. Vos hert zich?"

The old Jewish man indicates to Obama to bend down and then whispers in Obama's ear, "Obama is a shmuck. He has just driven to Brooklyn on his own and parked his car."



Vos hert zich?: What do you hear around? What's up?

### #2299 If I was a rich man

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Two shlemiels, Jonathan and Morrie, are on their way to work when they pass a parked lorry with dozens of rolls of turf on the back. Morrie points to the lorry and says, "When I win the lottery, that's exactly what I am going to do."

"Be a lorry driver?" says Jonathan.

"No," says Morrie. "I would never have to mow the lawn again - I'd be rich enough to send my grass out to be mowed."



shlemiel: a fool, a bungler

### #2300 What a difference this makes

Lionel returns home after getting a First-Class honours degree in Business Studies at Manchester University. His parents, Golda and Ruben, are thrilled because he's promised not only to help his father in his General store, but also hopefully come up with ideas to make it more profitable.

After just one day studying the store's paperwork, Lionel says to his father, "I'm sorry to tell you dad, but you've not been doing it right. You've been putting all your invoices, bank statements, customer correspondence and the like into one large file as soon as they drop through your letter box. As you're taking no notice of them, you're unable to do any proper analysis of your store's finances. But don't worry, dad. I'm going to get you a good accountant to help you out in this area. I'm sure he'll be able to change everything for the better."

"Thank you my boychick," says Ruben, "I knew you could help me."

Three weeks later, Golda can clearly see that all is not right with her Ruben. He's not sleeping well and he's walking around all day long muttering to himself, looking very worried and dejected. He's even begun to shake, and this worries her even more. So she says to him, "Oy Ruben, darling, you don't look too well. What's the matter, my lovely haimisheh mensch? You know you can tell me."

"I'm sorry darling," replies Ruben, "I just don't feel able to tell you."

"What do you mean you don't feel able to tell me?" says Golda. "I'm your wife aren't I? We've been married for over 25 years. And now you say you can't tell me? You must tell me, bubeleh, so that I can share your concerns and worries. I only want to help you."

So with tears in his eyes, Rubin says, "Darling, our new accountant told me last week that we're bankrupt and that's why I've been walking around in a daze ever since. I'm very worried about it. Should I do this, should I do that? I just can't think of anything. Oy vey, Golda, I think we're in deep trouble for the first time ever and your husband just doesn't know what to do."

When she hears this, Golda says, "The first thing you must do, Ruben, is to pull yourself together because I know what we must do. The answer is quite simple. Thank God, in the 25 years of our marriage, we've always had a roof over our heads; we've always had plenty of nosh on our plates; we've always been able to dress well and go on holiday each year; and we've been able to support our lovely Lionel while he studied. And where, may I ask, did all the money come from if not from our store? And nothing much has changed. We haven't changed, even if we look a teeny-weeny bit older; our store is the same; even our customers are mostly the same. So what then is different? Well I'll tell you Ruben, I'll tell you what's different. We now have an accountant, that's what's different. So we'll just have to get rid of him!"



boychick: young boy

haimisheh mensch: someone you feel at home with and who makes you feel comfortable. A warm person

bubeleh: not only is this a term of endearment used for children, it's also used for adults to mean dear, or darling

nosh: food

### #2301 Hide and Seek

[My thanks to Joe D and Ruth O for the following]

One evening, as he's driving around looking for business, 60 year old Moshe the taxi driver is shocked to be hailed by a totally naked woman. As soon as he pulls up next to her, she says to him in a very drunken manner, "Take me home at once."

Moshe finds it hard to believe what's happening and just sits there staring at her. After a short while, she drunkenly says to him, "So what's the matter with you then, sonny? You're staring at me. Have you never seen a beautiful naked lady before?"

"Vhat do you mean?" replies Moshe. "You tink I'm staring at a naked voman? Oy! det vould not be someting det mine community vould condone."

"But if you're not staring at my private parts," she says, "then what the hell are you doing looking at my body?"

"Vell if you must know," replies Moshe, "I'm looking hard at you because I'm having trouble trying to find vair you've put the money to pay me your fare."

### #2302 The escapee

[My thanks to John B and Becky D for the following]

One morning, as Joshua is walking along Parkway on his way to work, he encounters dozens of people running fast towards him. "It must be some kind of post-Olympic athletics competition," he says to himself. So when a runner wearing a kippa reaches him, Joshua stops him and asks, "Nu? So what's the event?"

Breathing very hard, the runner replies, "Event? Don't be meshugga. It's a large lion. It must have escaped from London Zoo."

"Oy vey!" says Joshua. "Which way is it heading?"

"You must be meshugga then," replies the runner. "Surely you don't think we're all chasing the lion?"



kippa: skullcap

meshugga: crazy, mad

### #2303 A sensible solution

David sits down at a table in MINKYS DELI, his favourite kosher restaurant. When the waiter arrives at his table, David says to him, "I'd like some roast duck, roast potatoes and some peas please."

"I'm very sorry sir," says the waiter, "but we don't have any roast duck today. We only have roast goose."

"But you always have roast duck when I ask for it," says David. "That's why I come here. That's what I always order. It's my favourite. Could you please go check with the manager."

The waiter goes to the manager and explains the situation, "Mr Levy is here again, and he's asked for some roast duck."

"Well tell him we don't have any roast duck today. Tell him we only have roast goose."

"I've told him this already," says the waiter, "but he's insisting that we give him his favourite meal, which is roast duck."

"Well, OK then," says the manager, "if he's insisting, we must do what he asks. The customer is always right!  Go to the Chef and tell him to cut a portion of roast duck from the roast goose."

### #2305 A husband's good advice

Rachel and Moshe are on holiday in New York and staying at a posh hotel. Whilst there, Rachel has some trouble getting dressed, so she says to Moshe, "Darling, please, I need you to help me decide what I should wear."

"Oy, not this again," says Moshe.

"Please!" begs Rachel.

"So what do you want to know this time?" asks Moshe.

"Oh thank you darling," replies Rachel. "I wouldn't know what I'd do without you."

"OK, OK," says Moshe, "cut out the schmooze and get to the point already."

So Rachel says, "I have only 3 questions to ask you this time. Firstly, should I wear my mink jacket, or should I wear my cashmere and lace top? Secondly, should I wear my diamond brooch or will my gold and topaz bracelet look fine? And lastly, should I wear my triple-strung pearl necklace or will my 24 ct gold tiara be adequate? So nu darling, what do you think?"

"Wear the mink jacket, the diamond broach and the tiara," replies Moshe, "but do hurry up or we'll be late for breakfast again."

### #2306 Chelm’s First Medical Student

Chaim Minky from Chelm passes his exams and as a result is awarded a place in Medical School. And because he's the first student from his town to do so well, all his family, all his friends and all his neighbours are very proud of him.

Six months into his training, he's with some other medical students doing the rounds at the Chelm Hospital with a qualified doctor. Stopping next to the records of one of the patients, the doctor takes out the patient's X-rays and says to the group, "As you can deduce from these X-rays, this patient limps badly because both his tibias and fibulas are radically arched. So let me ask you, Chaim Minky, what would you do in a case like this?"

After thinking about this for a short while, Chaim Minky replies, "I suppose I'd limp too, doctor."

### #2308 Shmutter business problems

It's Sunday and as Morris is doing some shopping in Brent Cross Shopping Centre, he meets Henry, one of his old friends. "Hi Henry," he says, "How's life treating you these days?"

"Thanks for asking," replies Henry, "but I'm actually in a terrible state."

"Oh I'm sorry to hear that," says Morris. "Why is that?"

"My Menswear shop is doing terrible," replies Henry, "that's why I'm in such a state. And I might have to close it down soon. For example, last Monday, I sold just one suit and one shirt all day. On Tuesday, it was even worse. No one even came into the shop. And the same thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday, so much so, in fact, that my salesmen started trying to sell clothes to one another."

"Oy vey," says Morris. "But at least you managed to sell a suit on the Monday."

"You're joking, aren't you," says Henry. "On Friday, the customer who bought the suit on Monday changed his mind and returned it to me un-worn!"

### #2310 Thin Air

[My thanks to Anna R for the following]

20 members of the Minky Jewish Community Centre are enjoying a trip to Switzerland. During their trip, they arrive at the top of Monte Rosa, the highest summit in the Swiss Alps, and are greeted by a small group of Swiss musicians. But then, fifteen minutes later - disaster!

A lederhosen-wearing alpenhorn player suddenly collapses in the middle of a song and lays very silent and still in the snow with his huge and heavy musical instrument by his side.

A doctor happens to be close by and tries to revive the alpenhorn player, but without any luck. It's too late - the alpenhorn player is dead. The doctor gets to his feet and says angrily to the Community Centre members, "I think whichever one of you requested these musicians to play the song Hava Nagila, especially up here on top of Monte Rosa, is totally meshugga."



Hava Nagila:  Famous Israeli music. A Hebrew folk song that has become a staple of band performers at Jewish weddings and Bar/Bat Mitzvahs.The music tends to get faster and faster and faster.

### #2314 Lokshen soup

[My thanks to the Simmons family for the following]

Christian, a very wealthy married man, has been having a secret affair with Naomi for a number of years. But then one night, out of the blue, Naomi says to him, "I'm pregnant, Christian."

He is devastated. There is no way he wants to ruin his reputation or his existing marriage. So after a short period of thinking on his part, he says to Naomi, "OK Naomi, I've decided what to do. You're Jewish and you've told me many times that you've always wanted to go to Israel. So here's my deal. I'll pay you £30,000 to go to Israel to have your baby in secret. And not only that. If you then decide to stay in Israel to raise your child, I'll pay you a further £5,000 every month as child support until your baby reaches the age of 16. What do you think of that?"

After a few minutes, Naomi replies, "OK, Christian. It's a deal. But how will you know when the baby is born?"

"It's important you remain discreet about this, Naomi," he replies, "so why don't you send me a postcard and write lokshen on the back. As soon as I receive this message, I'll arrange for child support to begin."

One day, 9 months later, Christian returns home from work to find his wife very confused. "What's the matter darling?" he asks her.

"Oh it's just that you received this very odd postcard this morning from Israel," she replies, handing him the card.

Christian looks at the card, turns it over, and goes absolutely white. On the back of the card was written the following:

"lokshen, lokshen, lokshen, and lokshen. 2 with knaydlach, 2 without. Please send extra soup."



lokshen: noodles

knaydlach: matzo ball served in soup

### #2316 Clever too much

[My thanks to Brian C for the following]

16 year old Daniel decides to get some work experience during the summer holidays. After a few interviews, he chooses to work for a large General store.

On his first day at work, the store manager says to him, "Whenever a customer comes into the store, Daniel, it's important to realise that whatever he or she is thinking of buying, there is always something else we can suggest they buy. The key to doing this is to think of a link between the two items. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir," replies Daniel, "I think I do."

"Good," says the manager, "because a potential customer has just come into the store. Let me show you how it's done."

They walk over to the customer and the manager says, "How can I help you, sir?"

"I'm looking for some strong grass seed," replies the customer.

"You've come to the right place then," says the manager, leading the customer to the garden section. The manager takes a packet of seed off the shelf and says, "This is the grass variety I suggest you buy, but with the weather we're currently experiencing, all grass will grow fast. So you'll regularly need to use a good, strong lawn mower. In fact, did you notice that we have such a mower on special offer just for today. It's a bargain - 50% off!"

The customer thinks about this for a while, then says, "OK, I'll buy the grass seed you suggest, and I'll also take the mower."

After the customer has driven off with the seed and mower in his car, the manager says to Daniel, "And that's how it's done. I just linked a mower to the seed. It's that easy. So now go back into the store and get some business for us."

A few minutes later, a man walks into the store, goes over to Daniel and says,

"My wife has asked me to get her a packet of sanitary towels. Do you have any?"

Daniel walks with the customer over to the store's pharmacy section and quickly finds what the customer is looking for. As he hands the packet to the customer, Daniel says to him, "And may I also suggest that you buy a new lawn mower today. We have one on special sale at 50% off."

"No thank you," says the customer, as he walks to the pay desk.

The manager hears this conversation and goes over to Daniel. "What do you think you are doing Daniel? I said you need to suggest something to customers that link with the item they've chosen. How on earth can you link sanitary towels with a lawn mower?"

"Well," replies Daniel, "I thought that because his wife wanted some sanitary towels, it was very likely that the following days were not going to be very sexy for this gentleman, so he might just as well mow his lawn."

### #2318 Customer Focus

Rachel and her husband Max are in 'Minkys', their local kosher restaurant. Even though Rachel always seems to find something to moan about in Minkys, they still regularly go there because the food is good and it's frequented by many of their fellow seniors.

As usual, within minutes of taking their seats, Rachel starts to bother their waiter. "Waiter," she says, "please turn up the air conditioning. You know I can't stand a hot atmosphere."

But then, five minutes later, she asks the waiter to turn down the air conditioning because she is too cold. Soon after, she wants it turned up again because she's getting too hot. But then their food arrives on the table and Rachel is at last silent as she eats her meal.

Maurice, who is sitting near Rachel and Max's table, can't help but notice that at no time does the waiter show any anger - in fact he is surprisingly patient. So as the waiter walks past his table on his way back to the kitchen, Maurice calls him over and says quietly to him, "I can't understand why you don't just throw this customer out of the restaurant."

"Oh, we don't really mind," says the waiter, "because not only do we have a customer focus program in operation where the customer is always right, but also, this restaurant doesn't have any air conditioning."

### #2322 The regular diner

[my thanks to Leonard A for the following]

It's lunchtime and 70 year old Moshe walks into Minky's Diner for his daily bowl of matzo ball soup. Moshe always goes to Minky's for his soup. He is also always punctual - so much so that the waiters always know he is coming in and always have his table and his soup ready for him. Everyone likes Moshe because he is always smiling and always has a good word for them.

As usual, Moshe sits down at his table and smiles at Steve, his regular waiter. Almost immediately, a bowl of soup is placed in front of Moshe. But this time, as Steve is walking away, Moshe quickly calls him back to his table.

"Please taste this soup." Moshe says to Steve.

"Why?" asks Steve. "What's the matter with the soup? It's the same soup as you always have."

"Please taste the soup," Moshe says again to Steve.

"But there's nothing wrong with your soup. It's been made the same way we always make it." says Steve.

"For the third time, Steve, I ask you to please taste the soup," says Moshe.

"Alright then .... if you insist," says Steve, looking around the table. "But where's the spoon?"

"Ah hah," shouts Moshe with a big smile on his face.

It was a fabulous affair and after all the guests had left, Morris and I went up to our room on the 2nd floor.

As soon as we had shut and locked our door, Morris came over to me and with a twinkle in his eyes said, 'Well, my darling Judith, the time has arrived at last. You know what you are here for, don't you?'

"And so my dear ladies, I turn to you now and say to you all, 'I'm sure that you know exactly what you are here for. So please give generously. You'll feel great afterwards. I did!"

### #2333 Experienced lumberjack required

Isaac, an elderly, very thin looking man, sees an advert in a Haifa newspaper:

EXPERIENCED LUMBERJACK REQUIRED IN HAIFA

So he applies for the job and a week later he is asked to attend an interview in Haifa with the foreman.

During his interview, the foreman says to Isaac, "I can't help but notice your age and your body build. Are you sure you're a lumberjack?"

"Yes, of course I am. Would I have applied if I wasn't?"

So the foreman gives Isaac an axe, takes him outside, points to a sapling growing near them and says to Isaac, "OK then, lets see you chop this down."

Isaac walks over to the sapling and with one blow of the axe chops it down.

The foreman then points out a larger tree and says, "try this one, then."

Again, Isaac walks over to the tree and cuts it down effortlessly with one blow of the axe.

The foreman is amazed, but tries one more time. Pointing this time to a really large tree with a thick trunk, he says to Isaac, "OK, try this one then if you can."

Isaac walks over to the tree, takes a deep breath, swings his axe and with one swoop, the large tree comes crashing down.

"I can't believe what I've just seen you do," says the foreman. "You're fantastic. Where did you learn to be such a great lumberjack?"

"Well if you must know," replies Isaac, "I worked in the Sahara Park for a long time."

"Don't you mean the Sahara Desert?" asks the foreman.

"NOW it's a desert," replies Isaac.

Rabbi Levy ignores this because his other congregants always say nice things to him about his sermons as they leave the shul.

But then, some weeks later, as Maurice is leaving shul, he surprises Rabbi Levy by going over to him for the first time and saying, "Thank you rabbi. I really do enjoy your sermons."

"Thank you Maurice," says Rabbi Levy, "but I've noticed for some time now that you always fall asleep during my sermons. So how can you say you enjoy them?"

"Rabbi," replies Maurice, "you should be pleased to hear that it would be impossible for me to go to sleep during your sermons if I didn't explicitly trust you."

### #2341 A New Year's question

Rabbi Bloom enters the under sevens Hebrew class. It will soon be Rosh Hashanah and he's there to blow the shofar for them. But before he does, he decides to ask them a relevant question. So hiding his shofar behind his back, he says to the class, "Shalom, boys and girls. I have a question for you. Can anyone here tell me what we will see in shul on Rosh Hashanah but which we would not normally see in shul at other times of the year?"

Little Samuel puts up his hand and says, "I know the answer, rabbi. It's my mummy."



shofar: A ram's horn blown in the shul (synagogue) during services for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur

### #2342 Is honesty the best policy?

As he's out shopping, Mervyn meets one of his customers. "So Abe," he says, "you know you still owe me £450. When will I get it?"

"Don't worry, Mervyn," replies Abe. "You'll get it first thing tomorrow morning."

"Oy vey, not again," says Mervyn. "It's always tomorrow with you. I'm just sick and tired of hearing you say you'll pay me tomorrow, but then getting a follow-up phone call from you telling me that you haven't got enough money to pay me. Last week you rang and told me you couldn't pay. Last month you rang and told me you couldn't pay. Three months ago you rang and told me you couldn't pay. Six months ........."

"Enough already," interrupts Abe. "So didn't I keep my word each time?"

"Well how about if I told you that we both ate here last night?" says Jonathan."

"So what?" says the man. "Many people ate here last night."

"I know," says Jonathan, "but I recognised you right away because of the fancy patterned umbrella you have on the chair next to you."

"Ah hah," says the man, "I never had this umbrella with me when I ate here last night."

"I know," says Jonathan, "But I did!"

### #2345 How to handle a patient

[My thanks to John B for the following]

Hyman is not very well and is taken to a hospital in Jerusalem. As soon as he arrives, he's checked over by a specialist and is quickly sent to their Cardiology ward where a nurse gives him some pyjamas and helps him into bed. As she is plumping up his pillow, Hyman says to her, "I'm so very worried nurse."

"Why on earth should you be worried?" asks the nurse.

"Because last week," replies Hyman, "I remember reading of a patient who was in hospital because of heart trouble, but who then suddenly died of Septic Shock."

"Relax," says the nurse, "that was in another hospital. This is a first-rate hospital and when we treat someone for heart trouble, he dies of heart trouble."

### #2346 Change of name?

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Miriam begins to notice that whenever her 5 year old daughter Sarah is asked her name, she answers, "I'm Mrs Freedman's daughter."

So one day, just before bedtime, Miriam says to Sarah, "Bubbeleh, whenever anyone asks you what your name is, you must not say, 'I'm Mrs Freedman's daughter.' Instead, you must proudly say, 'my name is Sarah.' Sarah is such a beautiful name - the bible even tells us that another lovely Sarah was the wife of Abraham and the mother of Isaac."

"OK, mummy," says Sarah.

Later that week, a rabbi is visiting Sarah's class at school and as soon as he sees Sarah, he goes over to her and says, "Hello, aren't you Mrs Freedman's  daughter?"

"I thought I was," replies Sarah, "but my mummy says I'm not."



bubbeleh: Term of endearment (like dear, pet, honey)

Sarah: The bible tells us that the Hebrew name Sarah indicates a woman of high rank and is translated as "princess."

[My thanks to John T for the following]

Ruth phones her local hospital and angrily says, "I'm Mrs Sheldon and I thought I should let you know that I'm planning to sue your hospital."

"Oh why is that, Mrs Sheldon?" asks the hospital.

Ruth replies, "Well my Hymie has just returned home after being treated in your hospital, and he now shows absolutely no interest in me at all and very little interest in sex."

The hospital says, "I've just looked up our records and I can see that a gentleman called Hymie Sheldon was recently admitted to our hospital. But he was admitted to our Ophthalmology department and all we did was correct his eyesight."

### #2348 Neatness is not everything

Joshua is talking to his friend Arnold. "My Naomi is progressively getting more and more farmisht, and all because she desires to have a totally neat and tidy house."

"So nu, tell me already," asks Arnold, "what has happened this time?"

### #2349 The change over

As Moshe is on his way to work one morning in Tel Aviv, he sees a man on the other side of the road who looks very familiar. So he crosses the road, goes over the man and says, "Hi. I'm sure we've met at some time in the past. Wasn't it in London?"

"Yes, I do come from London," replies the man. "My name is Riley."

"And what are you doing over here in Tel Aviv?" asks Moshe.

Riley replies, "I've come here to live the life of Cohen."

### XXX#000 The Accident (version 2)

[My thanks to Boris S for suggesting this alternative version to naughty joke xxx#35]

Chaim wakes up in a Tel Aviv hospital bed bandaged from head to foot. Dr. Levy comes in and says, "Ah, I see you've regained consciousness. Now you probably won't remember this, Chaim, but you were involved in a huge pile-up on the motorway."

"Oy vey," cries Chaim, "I’m going to die, I’m going to die."

"Chaim, listen to me," says Dr. Levy. "You're going to be OK. Really you are. You'll walk again and everything. But your shmeckel was severed in the accident and no one could find it."

"Oy vey iz meer," cries out Chaim, "I’m doomed to a life of misery."

"Chaim, you must look on the bright side of things," says Dr. Levy. "Your wife Hettie tells me that you've got 360,000 shekels in insurance compensation coming to you."

"And how is that going to help me?" asks Chaim, sarcastically.

"Well," replies Dr. Levy, "Israel now has the technology to build you a new shmeckel. They really perform well, but they’re not cheap. They work out at roughly 40,000 shekels an inch."

Chaim perks up.

"So, Chaim," says Dr. Levy, "all you have to do is decide how many inches you want. But a word of warning is necessary. This decision must not be taken lightly. You really must discuss it carefully with your wife Hettie."

"Why, doctor?" asks Chaim.

"I've obviously never measured your previous shmeckel," replies Dr. Levy, "but if you had, say, a 5 incher before and get a 9 incher now, Hettie might be a bit put out. But then on the other hand, if you had a 9 incher before and you decide to only invest in a 5 incher now, she might be ahntoisht. It's therefore essential that Hettie plays a key role in this important decision."

Chaim agrees to talk it over with Hettie.

Dr. Levy comes back the next day, "So nu, Chaim," he says, "have you spoken with Hettie?"

"Yes I have doctor," replies Chaim.

"And has she helped you come to a decision?" asks Dr. Levy.

"Yes she has," says Chaim, looking very glum.

"So what is your decision?" asks Dr. Levy.

"We're going to invest in a new modern kitchen with granite worktops and then we’re going on a Caribbean cruise."



shmeckel: (slang) penis

ahntoisht: disappointed

### #2350 Forthcoming new car

[My thanks to Lars-T for the following]

As most of you probably know, the Toyota Yaris and the Toyota Auris are cars that are sold worldwide. And now I can announce that Toyota will soon be launching a new car. Not only that, but Toyota has reached an agreement with Israel that this new Toyota model will only be sold in Israel and in various Jewish settlements around the world.

This forthcoming new Toyota car has been specially designed for the elderly and is going to be called the Toyota Tsouris.



tsouris: troubles, worries, suffering.

### #2351 Isaac's meeting with his boss

Isaac pops his head into his boss's office and says, "Excuse me Mr Levy, but is now a good time to talk to you about a decision I have to make?"

"Sure Isaac," says Mr Levy. "Come in and sit down. How can I help you?"

"Well sir," replies Isaac, "I'm sure you know this, but I've been working for your firm now for nearly 7 years."

"Yes, of course I know that," says Mr Levy. "You're a very good worker."

"Thank you sir," says Isaac. "So I'll come straight to the point. I'd like a raise. I currently have 4 companies after me. But I thought before making a decision, I should really talk to you first."

"So you'd like a raise, eh?" says Mr Levy. "I fully understand your position and I'd love to give you a raise. But now is not a good time because the current double-dip economic situation is having a negative impact on our sales."

"Yes, I know this," says Isaac, "but you must also take into consideration my hard work, my pro-activeness, my revenue earning skills, and my undivided loyalty to this company over the 7 years I've been here."

On hearing this, Mr Levy sits in silence for a while, thinking carefully about what he's just heard. Then he says to Isaac, "OK, Isaac. Taking into account all your positive attributes, and considering that I don't want to start a brain drain by just letting you go, I'm willing to offer you a pay raise of £2,500 per year plus an extra five days annual holiday. How does that grab you?"

"Great! It's a deal," replies Isaac. "Thank you, sir."

"Good," says Mr Levy. I'll write to you today to confirm this. But before you go, just out of curiosity, could you tell me what companies are after you?"

"Oh, the Electric Company, the Gas Company, the Water Company and the Telecom Company!" replies Isaac.

[My thanks to Jay F for the following]

Morris has at last passed his final medical exam and is now a fully qualified doctor. Today, he's telling his friend Nathan about his exams.

"You wouldn't believe it," says Morris, "but the final question we were all given, and which was important for us to get right, was -

Re-arrange the five letters P N E S I  to spell a part of the human body that is extremely important when erect.

"So nu? What's so difficult about that question?" asks Nathan. "Even I know the answer is PENIS."

"Well that was the wrong answer." says Morris. "Only those students who answered "SPINE" passed and became doctors."

NOTE: Those who got it wrong eventually became joke book authors."

[My thanks to John B for the following]

Two stockbrokers, Morrie and Gary, are talking business during a quick lunch time snack. But then quite suddenly, Morrie says, "We've got to stop all this serious business talk over lunch. It's not good for our health. We need to talk about other things and relax more."

"That's a good idea," says Gary. "So what do you suggest we talk about instead?"

"Let's talk about women, lots of women," suggests Morrie.

"OK, let's do it," says Gary. "But what type of women should we talk about? Preferred stock? Single stock? or Common stock?"

### #2355 Preparation for an interview

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Brian applies for membership of his local golf club and is asked to attend an interview with the club's Chairman. But Brian is no meshugganah - he knows that the Chairman doesn't like Jews. So he prepares a suitable response should the Chairman ask him what his religion is.

During his interview, all is going well for Brian. But then comes the question he's been expecting. "So what is your religious persuasion, Mr Roberts?" asks the Chairman.

Brian replies, "I am proud to say that I'm a member of the Catholic Church. My wife Christine is also Catholic. We've been married now for over 20 years and in that time we've raised four lovely children - Shaun is the oldest, then there is Mary, Joan and Peter. All four of them regularly go to church with us - we regard ourselves as active Church members.  And even my late father, alav hasholom, was a Catholic."

Brian's membership application was unfortunately turned down.



meshugganah: a crazy person

alav hasholom: may he [or she] rest in peace

It's morning and Miriam goes to the stairs and shouts out loudly and angrily, "Breakfast is ready."

Five minutes later, Bernie enters the kitchen and sits down. They then quietly start eating their breakfast with neither saying a word to the other. It would have been obvious to any bystander that their long marriage is almost kaput.

Suddenly, Miriam shouts at him, "I bet you don't know what day it is today?"

Without looking up, Bernie replies, "It's Tuesday."

"No it's not, you shmuck," cries Miriam, "it's more than that. Today is our 30th Wedding Anniversary!"

"Oh, thanks for reminding me," says Bernie, as he gets up and leaves the kitchen. A few minutes later, he returns wearing his kippa and tallis. He then starts praying. "Yisgadal v'yiskadash sh'mei rabbaw."

Mother: "Recently he had lice in his hair, but probably that is now over and done with."

Rabbi: "Lice? Lice are also kosher. What else?"

Mother: "Well yesterday I noticed a scab on his scalp."

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

One shabbes morning, as the Minky family are walking home from Edgware shul after a great service by their rabbi, 9 year old Sam says to his father Lionel, "When I grow up, dad, I've decided to be a rabbi."

"Well Sam," says Lionel, "I have no problem with that. But tell me, why have you now decided to be a rabbi? You were going to be a footballer last week."

"I know I was," replies Sam, "but during the shul service I realised that I would be going to shul every shabbes for the rest of my life - and that's a long time. So I came to the conclusion that it would be much better to be standing up and shouting than just sitting down and listening."

### #2371 The other Yiddishe mother

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Leah is telling her best friend Hannah how her first date with the handsome Jonathan went. "He took me to a nice kosher restaurant in Bushey where we had a great meal," says Leah. "But then, as soon as we left the restaurant, he asked me whether we could both go back to my apartment."

"So what did you tell him?" asks Hannah, excitedly.

"I told him NO," replies Leah. "I said that my mother would do a great deal of worrying if I did anything like taking a new date back to my apartment."

"And how did Jonathan respond to that?" asks Hannah.

"He just refused to take NO for an answer," replies Leah, "and kept on and on schmoozing me to try to get me to take us back to my apartment."

"I hope you didn't weaken," says Hannah, "because knowing your mother, she really would plotz if you gave in to this new date of yours."

"No, Hannah, I didn't give in to this haimisheh mensh," says Leah. "But in the end, I agreed to go back to his apartment - I thought it would be far better to let his mother do the worrying."



schmoozing: gossiping, chatting up, coaxing

plotz: explode, collapse, drop dead with worry

### #2372 Avoiding repercussion

[My thanks to Lars-Toralf for the following]

Monty comes down to breakfast one morning in a serious mood. Whilst his wife Rose is making their breakfast, he looks closely at her and thinks to himself, "We've been married now for nearly 25 years and instead of growing closer, we seem to have drifted further apart than ever. Our relationship is almost non-existent. Oy Vey! Whatever has happened to us?"

But just then, Rose turns to him and says, "I notice you've been looking at me. Do you know what day it is today?"

"It's Wednesday," replies Monty.

"No, you shmuck," replies Rose, "today is our wedding anniversary, that's what day it is."

After a short pause, Monty replies, "Yes, so it is. Thanks for telling me Rose."

Monty then gets up and briefly leaves the kitchen. Returning a few minutes later wearing his kippa and tallis, he starts praying, "Yisgadal, v'yiskadash shmai raba..."



shmuck: a stupid person, a penis (vulg)

Yisgadal v'yiskadash shmai raba: Magnified and sanctified be His great name. This is the first line of the Kaddish.

Kaddish: (extracted from that great website "chabad.org"). The Kaddish is recited at the conclusion of all major prayers; after a Talmud study period; at the cemetery after burial; at services during the year of mourning; and at every yahrzeit. The Sages say that one who recites the Kaddish with all his inner power and conviction will merit the abolition of any severe Divine decree directed against him. In fact, they contended that the whole world itself, as it were, is maintained because of its recital, and that it redeems the deceased, specifically from perdition.

yahrtzeit: the anniversary of someone's death

### #2373 A successful outcome

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Hannah and Benny are not only regular shul goers, but are also members of their shul choir. They especially enjoy their choir's Wednesday night visits to Minky's Kosher Wine Bar for an evening of relaxation and joke telling.

Unfortunately, Hannah begins to notice that whenever she goes to Minky's and drinks a glass of her favourite wine, she gets a headache. So from the following Wednesday onwards, even though it was boring, she switches to drinking a glass of water instead of wine.

Two months later, Hannah and Benny go on their own to Minky's on a Thursday night to test out whether she can tolerate a different make of wine. And she can - she gets no headache. She's so happy that she shouts across the table to Benny, "Benny, darling, you'll be so very pleased to know that I don't have a headache tonight."

Immediately, everyone in Minky's shouts out, "Mazeltov Benny! Enjoy yourself."

### #2374 That's entertainment?

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Freda and Bernard have just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary and are going through a very difficult time, money wise. No matter what they try, they still end up each month in debt. Nevertheless, Bernard is an optimist by heart and starts to use a new catch phrase he's just put together. He says to Freda, "Don't worry about our poor financial situation Freda because as long as we have each other, we don't need anyone or anything else."

Bernard's sentiment works fine for a few weeks but then, all of a sudden, their bedroom TV packs up and Bernard spends time trying to fix it. After a few hours of poking around inside the back of the TV, Bernard says to Freda, "Sorry, I can't fix it. And we don't have enough money to either call in an engineer or to buy another TV."

"That's just marvellous isn't it!" shouts Freda. "Now there's absolutely no entertainment remaining in our bedroom."

As Simon is leaving the house, Ruth shouts once more at him. "And I really hope you die a long, slow and painful death."

[My thanks to Hilary for the following]

Sarah is talking to her friend Estelle about her neighbour. "You should hear what she regularly says about her husband, poor guy. She never has a good word to say about him. I think she must have graduated from the l'shon ha'ra school. And do you know what, Estelle? He's really not such a bad man. I mean look at me - my Hymie is a fat, lazy slob and cheap as they come.

[My thanks to Diane M for the following]

Whilst 75 year old Benny is in Golders Green, he feels the need of a cup of coffee. So he pops into Blooms Coffee shop. He's never been in there before but it seems nice and clean and there is even some loud music playing in the background.

But whilst Benny is drinking his coffee, his stomach starts rumbling and he quickly realizes that he desperately needs to fortz. Although the place is full of customers, the music is really loud, so he decides to get relief right away - and to further reduce any embarrassment, he decides to time his fortzing to the beat of the music.

This he accurately does and after a couple of songs, he starts to feel much better. But then, as he finishes his coffee, he notices that everyone is staring at him….

Oy Vey, Benny suddenly remembers that he was listening to his iPod.

NOTE: This is what can happen when old people start using modern technology!



fortz: (vulgar) fart

### #2379 Secrets of a Happy Marriage (from a man's point of view)

[My thanks to Geoffrey C for this composite of some familiar one-liners and bits of his own.]

[If any female reader has some favourite anti-men one liners, please send them to me]

•    My wife and I have discovered the secret to making a marriage last. Twice a week we dress smart casual and go to a nice kosher restaurant, have some superb food, an expensive wine and companionship. She goes Tuesdays and I go Fridays.

•    My wife and I sleep in separate beds these days - her bed is in Golders Green, mine is in Stamford Hill.

•    I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back.

•    When I asked my wife where she would like to go for our anniversary, she replied, "Somewhere I haven't been for a long time please." So I suggested the kitchen.

•    My wife and I always hold hands like a loving couple should. But the moment I let go, she's off shopping.

•    My credit card has been stolen. But I haven't reported it as fortunately, the thief is spending less money on it than my wife was.

•    Just remember that marriage is the number one cause for divorce. Statistically, 100% of all divorces start with marriage.

•    I thought I had married Miss Right. I just didn't know her name was 'Always'.

•    I haven't spoken to my wife for the last six months because I was taught that it's rude to interrupt.

•    My wife was on her mobile yesterday, chatting for half an hour before ringing off. "That was short," I said, "it's usually about two hours before you've had enough." "I know," she replied. "It was the wrong number."

•    The last time my wife and I had a fight, I admit it was definitely my fault. She asked me, "What's on the TV dear?" and I replied, "Dust!"

•    On the off-chance the other day, I asked my wife if she had even the slightest recollection of something that's about 5 inches long and about 2 inches wide which used to drive her wild with excitement. She replied, "Yes dear, a £50 note."

### #2383 More is best

Two pensioners, Judith and Leah, meet by chance at Brent Cross shopping centre. Leah takes one look at Judith and says, "I see you've bought yourself a new pair of glasses."

"That's very observant of you Leah," replies Judith. "Yes, I've just picked them up from my optician. They are the third pair of glasses I now carry around with me."

"Oy vey!," says Leah, "your third pair? Why do you need to carry around so many pairs of glasses?"

### #2384 Tit for Tat

Rabbi Levy and Father O'Shamus are best of friends and today they are having a chat in Father O'Shamus's house. During their conversation, Father O'Shamus surprises Rabbi Levy by suddenly getting up from his chair and saying, "Rabbi, I have made some lovely Ham sandwiches especially for us. How many shall I put on your plate?"

"I'm sorry, Father," replies Rabbi Levy, "but although your kind offer is very tempting, you must know that we Jews don't eat Pork of any kind. It's not kosher."

"I know that, Rabbi," says Father O'Shamus, "but I was hoping to persuade you - I wouldn't tell anyone and so no one would know."

"Thank you for your kind offer, Father," says Rabbi Levy, "but I really won't be able to accept it."

But Father O'Shamus is very persistent. "Oh please Rabbi, please accept my offer."

"Alright, OK," says Rabbi Levy, smiling. "You win. I'll have a Ham sandwich - but only at your wedding!"

### #2385 Shopping Heaven?

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Talia is out shopping in Brent Cross Shopping Centre. She just loves shopping - it's her perfect past-time and it also gets her away from her husband for a few hours.

She starts her shopping expedition by looking for and eventually buying a new pair of shoes. Then she moves on to looking for a new outfit for her forthcoming Mediterranean cruise.  She soon finds the perfect suit and buys it. Then she notices one of the Centre's stores is offering up to 75% off all household goods. Talia just can't resist such an offer and instantly makes her way towards the Sale. She is gloriously happy. But then her mobile phone rings.

"Hello, says the voice on her phone, "I'm Doctor Smith from the Herts Hospital. We met recently when you and your husband came in to sort out a badly bleeding cut on your hand."

"Oh yes, doctor," says Talia. "I remember. How can I help you?"

"I'm afraid to tell you that your husband has been involved in a three-car crash and he's just arrived here by ambulance. I think you should come in as soon as possible."

"OK doctor," says Talia, "but I'm in the middle of shopping in Brent Cross. Please tell my husband I'll be with him as soon as I can."

As soon as she hangs up, Talia takes a quick look at the 75% sale items. And she quickly forgets her husband's predicament as she sees all the fantastic items on offer. Eventually, after many purchases, she leaves Brent Cross and makes her way to Herts Hospital carrying a number of carrier bags in her hands.

She finds Dr. Smith and asks, "So how is my husband, doctor?"

Frowning, Dr. Smith replies, "So you really went ahead and finished your shopping trip didn't you? I hope you're satisfied with the outcome, because while you've been enjoying yourself for the last few hours, your husband has been languishing in our Intensive Care Unit. In fact it's likely to be the last shopping trip you'll take because your husband will require round-the-clock care for the rest of his life and caring for him will be your main task."

On hearing this, Talia starts to cry uncontrollably.

But then Doctor Smith starts to laugh and says, "Don't worry, Talia, I was only joking. Unfortunately, your husband died an hour ago. So come on, show me already what's in your shopping bags - show me what you bought."

### #2386 A positive conclusion

Moshe says to his friend Monty, "I've been doing a lot of thinking recently and based on many years of marriage, I've come to a remarkable conclusion."

"This I want to hear already," says Monty. "So tell me about your wonderful conclusion."

"I've discovered," says Moshe, "that if a husband only slightly upsets his wife, it's almost certain that she will shout at him. Fair enough! But if the husband continues to upset her, she won't shout louder but instead will give him the silent treatment."

But before Moshe can continue, Monty says to him, "Wonderful! It's nice to learn that it's sometimes worthwhile putting in extra effort."

### #2387 Worse and worser!

The El Al Airlines plane has just reached its cruising altitude and Captain Levy is making his usual announcement. "Good morning ladies and gentlemen. You'll be pleased to learn that we have now reached our cruising altitude. The weather ahead is fine and we expect our flight to Tel Aviv to be a smooth one, with our estimated arrival time to be 2.30pm. So why don't you relax, watch some movies and ........ "

The captain's announcement suddenly ends with him screaming, "OY GEVALT!" and then there is silence throughout the plane.

However, 30 seconds later, Captain Levy comes back over the loud speaker.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry if I might have scared you just then. The truth is that while I was speaking to you, one of my flight attendants was refilling my cup with some boiling hot coffee and she accidentally spilled some directly on my lap - the worst place for a man to receive anything so hot. I'm OK now, but you should see the front of my trousers."

On hearing this, Moshe, an elderly passenger, shouts out, "And you, captain, you should see the back of my trousers!"



OY GEVALT: exclamation to denote fear, terror, astonishment

"So what have you found out that's so important?" replies Shmuel.

"I've discovered that Rivkah, the oldest daughter of Mr. Maurice Fountain, is at last getting married and she's going to marry a Rothschild, no less!"

"Well mazeltov to Maurice then," says Shmuel. "Ever since I've known him, he's always wanted to move in higher circles and now he's done it. By the way, did you know that when I first met him, everyone called him Moshe Waterjet?"

"That's nothing," replies Mordechai. "When I first met him, everyone called him Moshe Pisher!"

Sitting on the other side of the aisle to Leah is Naomi Gold and when she hears of Leah's problem, she leans over to Leah and says, "I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I think it's a bit unfair of you to blame the airline for not having any kosher food on board today."

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Today, Harry is interviewing a potential candidate for the job of butcher shop cashier. Her name is Suzy and she is not only a very orthodox young Jewish lady, but is also very attractive.

"I'd love to have someone like Suzy working for me," Harry thinks to himself. But then he quickly remembers the instructions his wife Kitty gave him that very morning. "Now remember Harry, you're looking for a cashier who can keep your financial records straight and who can prevent you from paying too much unnecessary tax. You are not looking for the next Miss World."

So Harry forces himself to check out Suzy's mathematical and financial ability. "OK, Suzy," he says to her. "If I were to give you £4,000 except 16%, how much would be taken off?"

Suzy immediately replies, "everything except my gold necklace and ring."

### #2396 Brave or what?

[My thanks to Vivian BC for the following]

This is the story of a hospital, and specifically, of the Minky Ward, where all the patients in it were not only in bed, but also had one of their legs suspended in a sling above them. One day, Henry the consultant, together with some of his staff, makes his rounds in the Minky Ward. Henry stops at the first bed and pulls and twists the patient's suspended leg. The patient screams in agony. This is repeated along the row of beds, and each patient screams and yells during the examination.

Henry finally reaches the last bed. This is occupied by Emanuel. But when Emanuel's suspended leg is pulled and twisted as was done to all the others, Emanuel  remained silent and smiling throughout the procedure.

When Henry and his entourage leave the ward, all the patients congratulate Emanuel on his bravery and fortitude, as they all had the same ailment.

But Emanuel responds by telling them, "Brave/shmave – I saw what the consultant was doing to you, so I switched my legs and put my good leg in the sling."

And almost immediately, Estelle shouts, "Issy, don't you think you are too near to the curb? You might hit it."

Then Ruth shouts, "Issy, could you please put on the radio."

And seconds later, Estelle shouts, "No Issy. I don't like the radio being on. I want peace and silence in the car."

Issy can't keep quiet any longer and says, "Ruth, who is driving this car, you or my mother?

### #2398 The Proposition

[My thanks to Peter M for the following]

Talia looks at her watch and sees it's 5.30pm - time to leave work. As she lives alone, she pops into Minky's Kosher Deli on her way home to buy something for her dinner. She chooses a piece of fried fish with some potato salad, some tomatoes and a small challah bread. She pays at the till and is about to leave when a man enters the shop. He appears to be in his late thirties and is so sexy looking that Talia can't take her eyes off him.

The man at once notices Talia staring at him and quickly walks over to her. Before Talia could apologise for staring so rudely at him, he whispers to her, "Hello beautiful. My name is David and I must say that it's so very, very nice to meet you. I'd also like you to know that I would do absolutely anything that you wanted me to do, no matter what or how sexy, for only £10. But there is a condition."

Talia is shocked to hear such outright talk from a stranger, but nevertheless is already so smitten by him that she asks, "So nu? What is this condition?"

David replies, "The condition is that you have to tell me what you want me to do in no more than three words."

It takes Talia only a few seconds to consider David's proposition. She takes a £10 note from her purse and writes her address on a piece of paper. Pressing both pieces of paper into his hand, she looks deeply into his eyes and says, with excitement and anticipation in her voice, "OK, I've decided. What I want you to do, in three words, is this: "Clean My House."

NOTE: It’s very hard to get good help these days!

### #2400 A visit to the Vet

[My thanks to Jay F for the following]

Abe's dog Benny has not been his usual self for some months, so Abe takes him to see the Vet.

"So what seems to be the problem with your dog?" the Vet asks.

"Well," replies Abe, "Benny is not only a truly Jewish dog, but he can also talk."

"He can talk?" says the Vet. "You're joking, aren't you?"

"No, I'm not joking," replies Abe. "Watch this!"

Abe goes over to Benny, points to the door, and says, "Fetch!"

Benny immediately starts trotting towards the door, but stops before he gets there. He then turns around and says, "Why oh why do you always talk to me like that? You're always ordering me around when you want something. I feel like a nudnik. You make me sleep on the floor even though you know I suffer from arthritis; you give me farcockteh food loaded with salt and fat which is so bad for my arthritis. You think by telling me it's a special diet food makes any difference? It still tastes like dreck! Why don't you try eating it yourself one day? And do you ever take me out for a decent walk around the area? No you don't. It's always out the house, with just enough time for a short pish and then it's immediately right back home again. How on earth can I meet some nice girl dogs? And I would love to be able to stretch out a little at home so that the pain from my sciatica wouldn't be killing me so much! I should roll over and play dead for real for all you care!"

The Vet is absolutely amazed. "This is absolutely remarkable. I've never seen a talking dog before. But let's get back to why you've bough him in. What's the problem with him?"

"He has a bad hearing problem," replies Abe. "I said "fetch," and Benny thinks I said "kvetch."



nudnik: a silly nuisance

farcockteh (rude): shitty

dreck: rubbish, trash

pish: piddle, urinate

kvetch: complain

### #2404 The Rabbi's help

[My thanks to Lars-Toralf for the following]

Benjamin goes to see Rabbi Levy. "Rabbi," he says, "my life is in ruins. My Judith has left me and she's taken our children and our dog with her. She has also taken all my money and my car and as a result my business is in ruins. Please help me Rabbi, I don't know what to do." After a few minutes thinking about the problem, Rabbi Levy replies, "OK Benjamin, here is what you should do. Go home and open up your bible to any page. Point randomly anywhere on that page and whatever it says, you must do. Do you understand?"

"Yes Rabbi," replies Benjamin, "I'll try."

So Benjamin goes home, takes his Bible from his bookcase, sits down with it, opens it to a random page, points and reads.

Six months later, Benjamin goes to see Rabbi Levy again. "Rabbi," he says, "since I saw you last, I've become a new man. I've remarried and become very successful in my business. I've even got a new dog and called it Levy after you. So I want to thank you Rabbi for the advice you gave me. It changed my life."

"If you don't mind me asking," says Rabbi Levy, "I've got a bad memory. What did I suggest you do that helped you so much?"

"Well rabbi, you told me six months ago to open my Bible to any page, point, and to do what it says."

"So what did it say?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Chapter 11," replies Benjamin.



Chapter 11 is a chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to every business, whether organized as a corporation or sole proprietorship, and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities.

"Really?" says Maurice. "I'm told a well known person called Mordechai lives in Bushey. Have you heard of him?"

"Have I heard of him?" replies Arnold, "Of course I've heard of him. He's a bondit and a groisser sheeser. He's stubborn and thinks he's the best at everything. He borrows money from anyone he meets and it takes great effort to get it back from him. He's a khazer and even eats on Yom Kippur. And he's had affairs which his wife doesn't know about."

"Oy, what a horrible person! How come you know so much about him?" asks Maurice.

"He's my best friend," replies Arnold.

groisser sheeser: a big shot

### #2411  The escape

12 year old Paul, holding a harmonica in his hand, comes to visit his grandfather David. "Zeyda," says Paul, "look what daddy bought me. Can I play it to you?"

"Of course you can, bubbeleh," replies David. "It's a lovely present and you know that I love all kinds of music. But before you play it for me, let me tell you a story about why music is so very important to our family. I bet you didn't know that music once saved bubbeh's and my life."

"No I didn't. What happened zeyda?" asks Paul.

"Many years ago," replies David, "we had such bad flooding here in Edgware that water just poured into our house. And within minutes the water was up to our waists. I quickly realised that we had to get out quickly, so I put bubbeh on the kitchen table, pushed her out of the house and she floated to safety."

"And how did you get out of the house?" asks Paul.

"I accompanied your bubbeh on the piano," replies David, smiling. "Now show me how well you can play your harmonica."

### #2412 That's how

[My thanks to Vivian BS  for the following]

Sarah is a typical Jewish mother - she loves her 10 year old son Paul dearly and is very protective. Today, she and her husband Bernard are going out for a rare evening meal with some close friends and she's been trying to find a babysitter, but without much success. So she says to Paul, "bubbeleh, your daddy and I are shortly going out for dinner to the Minkovs. As you know, they're only a few streets away, but unfortunately, bubbeleh, we can't find a baby sitter for you. But I think we can safely leave you alone at home tonight. After all, you have the TV to watch, our dog Moishe will be with you and will bark if anyone comes to the door. And I'll leave you our phone number in case you need us. We can be back home in 5 minutes if need be. Are you happy with doing this bubbeleh?"

"Of course mum," replies Paul. "I'll be alright. In fact, I think I'll invite my friend Esther from across the road to join me. She and I go to the same cheder. We can then watch TV together."

"What a good idea, bubbeleh," says Sarah. "If you do that, I won’t need to worry too much that you'll be alone."

As soon as Sarah and Bernard leave, Paul phones Esther and within minutes, she joins him.

"So Paul," Esther asks with a mischievous smile on her face. "what do you think we should do tonight?"

"I know," says Paul, "why don't we play mums and dads?"

"So what's your version of this game?" asks Esther.

"We'll go upstairs to my parents bedroom," replies Paul, "turn off the light, take off all our clothes and get into bed."

"And then what do we do?" asks Rachel, getting a bit embarrassed.

"Then we can speak Yiddish to each other." replies Paul.

### #2413 The Song Title

[My thanks to Howard K for the following]

Ruben is a very simple person and his knowledge of American history, politics, music, and humour is limited, as is his translation of Yinglish. He has just returned to England from a first time visit to the USA and as soon as his Ocean Liner docks, his friend Yehudah is waiting for him. On their way home, Yehudah wants to hear some of the highlights of Ruben's trip, so he asks, "Tell me Ruben, what was it you liked best about America?"

"What was it I liked about America the best?" replies Ruben. "Well, there were some great things there I saw and visited, but to me their music was the most interesting. The song I heard and liked the best was written by a patriotic shtick named George M. Cohan. Although he died in the 1940s, I've fallen in love with one of his songs. But I just can't seem to be able to connect the song's lyrics with the song's title."

"Let me see if I can help you," says Yehudah. "So what is this Cohan song that you've fallen in love with called?"

Reuben replies, "Cohan called it, 'Yank your doodle, it's a dandy.'"

### #2417 Why are you here?

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Sir Isaac Levy, the renowned solo Mountain Climber and Explorer is planning yet another dangerous adventure - this time to the deepest African jungles. Because Sir Isaac this time needs someone to accompany him on the trip, he puts an advert in the Jewish Chronicle. The advert reads:

WANTED, A COMPANION TO ACCOMPANY ME ON A DANGEROUS TRIP TO THE DEEPEST JUNGLES OF AFRICA. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, YOU MUST BE OF A RUGGED NATURE AND ABLE TO EXIST SOLELY ON PLANT ROOTS AND BERRIES. YOU MUST ALSO BE CAPABLE OF COOKING IN JUNGLES; HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF TROPICAL MEDICINE; BE ADEPT AT HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT; KNOW HOW TO TRAP DANGEROUS ANIMALS FOR FOOD; AND BE FAMILIAR WITH HAND GUNS AND RIFLES.  PLEASE WRITE WITH FULL PARTICULARS TO SIR ISAAC LEVY, THE JC, BOX 11111.

Late one evening some days later, there's a knock on Sir Isaac's front door. He opens it and there stands Hymie, a short, very thin, weak-looking man.

"Yes? what do you want at this time of night?" asks Sir Isaac.

"Are you the boychick that put the jungle advertisement in the JC?" asks Hymie in a strong Yiddish accent.

"Yes I am that person," replies Sir Isaac, laughing. "I admit to placing the advert."

Sir Isaac then looks straight at Hymie and starts to question him. To each question, Hymie answers "No" together with a qualification.

"Do you know jungle cookery?"  "No, but I can make Tzimis and Cholent."

"Can you trap animals?"             "No, I can’t even kill a carp for gefilte fish."

"Can you handle weapons?"      "No, I don't like guns. They frighten me."

Finally Sir Isaac has had enough and asks, "So why are you really here?"

Hymie answers, "I just wanted you to know that on me you shouldn’t depend."

### #2418  Farborgn Viagra

[My thanks to Abe S for the following]

50 year old Miriam goes to see doctor Levy to ask his advice on how to revive her husband Joseph's libido.

"So have you tried Viagra?" asks doctor Levy. "It works wonders for most people."

"There's no point in me trying to get Joseph to take a Viagra pill," replies Miriam. "He won't take any pill, not even an aspirin."

"That doesn't have to be a problem," replies doctor Levy. "You can give Joseph  farborgn Viagra."

"What is farborgn Viagra?" she asked.

"It's when you drop the Viagra tablet into his coffee when he's not looking. He won't know it's there or even taste it, I promise you. Give it a try and then call me and let me know how things went. I'll give you a prescription for some pills now."

Three days later, Miriam phones doctor Levy and tells him that she did what he told her to do. "So Miriam," asks doctor Levy, "tell me already, did it work?"

"Did it work? you ask," replies Miriam, "Oy vey did it work. But it was horrible, just horrible, doctor."

"Really? So what happened?" asks doctor Levy.

"Well, I did as you advised and slipped a Viagra tablet into his coffee while he wasn't looking, and the effect was almost immediate. As he started to drink his coffee, he suddenly jumped straight up from his chair and looked at me with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his eye, and a large bulge in his trousers. Then with one swoop of his arms, before I could do or say anything, he sent the cups and saucers flying from the table. He then ripped all my clothes off and made mad passionate love to me then and there on the table."

"So why do you say it was horrible?" asks doctor Levy. "Wasn't his love making to your liking?"

"It was by far the most amazing, the most passionate, and the most satisfying love making I've ever experienced in our 30 years of marriage," replies Miriam.

"So nu, what was wrong with that?" asks doctor Levy.

"It's just that we'll never be allowed to book a table in Minky's Kosher Diner again," replies Miriam.

### #2420 Mistaken identity

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Harry is one of the friendliest people around. He's always looking for opportunities to help, no matter how trivial the situation. Today, he's doing some shopping in Sainsbury's Supermarket when he sees a mother with a young son in the confectionary section. The boy had just taken a bar of chocolate from the shelf and his mother is shouting at him, "Peter, put that down at once. You know it's not kosher."

As the boy is quietly putting the chocolate bar back on the shelf, Harry goes over to her and says, "Shalom madam. Did you know that Sainsbury's has a nice kosher section here in the store. Would you like me to show you where it is?"

"No thank you," she replies. "Why on earth would I want to go to the kosher section? I'm not Jewish."

"Oh I'm so sorry, I didn't know," replies Harry. "But why did you tell your boy to put back the chocolate bar because it wasn't kosher?"

"Because I'm always hearing the Jewish mothers say that to their children, and it always works for them." she replies.

### #2423 Memories

Joshua has just turned 80 and his family are holding a party to celebrate the event. But talking to his children and grandchildren during the party, Joshua realises for the first time that his memory is seriously in decline. This worries him greatly and so the following day, he goes to see doctor Levy.

"I'm really worried about how my age is beginning to affect my memory," Joshua says to doctor Levy.

"In what specific way?" asks doctor Levy. "Can you give me an example?"

"Well," replies Joshua, "my memory has always been very good indeed, but lately it's been failing me. I'm having a hard time remembering even basic things. For example, during my 80th birthday party yesterday, I couldn't even remember the names of my grandchildren, or where they lived. It's very worrying!"

"Well I wouldn't worry too much about it," says doctor Levy. "It sounds like you'll forget all about it tomorrow."

### #2424 Some Jewish folk sayings

•    Whenever a boring person leaves a room, those remaining feel as if somebody fascinating has just entered.

•    A rabbi whose congregation doesn't want him to leave their shul for good is not a rabbi. But a rabbi whose congregation force him to leave their shul for good is not a man.

•    A little coitus, never hoitus.

•    Life without humour is like life without legs.

•    You can hear laughter much further away than you can hear crying.

•    Whenever a father needs to help his son, both of them laugh; but whenever a son needs to help his father, both of them cry.

•    Insanity is actually hereditary - you get it from your children.

•    Gossip is when three women stand on a corner talking, and then one of them leaves.

•    Whenever you go into a restaurant, it's always a good idea to ask for a table near a waitress.

### #2425 Pay or else

[My thanks to Vivian BC for the following]

Out of the blue, Morris's boss tells him to go to Eastbourne to complete a business deal. As he has yahrtzeit the coming shabbes, Morris goes to the local shul in Eastbourne, explains his situation to the shammes, and then asks, "So is it possible for me to have the maftir aliyah this shabbes in your shul?"

The shammes looks in his diary and replies, "I'm very sorry, but the maftir aliyah has already been promised to one of our shul members."

"I fully understand the situation," says Morris, "but if I were to donate £20,000 to your shul fund, perhaps you could persuade your congregant to have another aliyah at another time?"

"I can't make such decisions," says the shammes," but wait here while I talk to the shul president and see what he has to say about it."

As soon as the shul president is advised, he tells the shammes, "Yes, please give the businessman the honour."

The shammes returns to Morris and says, "You'll be pleased to hear that we can give you maftir aliyah this shabbes. But as it's on shabbes, how will your donation be paid?"

"After shabbes is over, just come to the Grand Hotel," replies Morris. "That's where I'm staying. I'll then hand over a signed and certified cheque."

Early the following Sunday morning, the shammes drives to the Grand Hotel only to discover that Morris has just checked out. Reception tells the shammes that Morris had learned of an urgent matter and had left for Eastbourne Station only a few minutes earlier.

So the shammes gets back in his car and drives to the station where he catches Morris just about to board the train for London. But when the shammes asks Morris for the cheque, he's told it was impossible to arrange it at such short notice. "I'll post it to you as soon as I return, I promise," says Morris.

On hearing this, the shammes holds open the train's door to stop the train from leaving and says, "I knew I shouldn't have trusted you."

A Railway policeman is called to help out because a train is being delayed by a passenger. The policeman asks the shammes what was going on. The shammes explains, "this stranger comes to our shul and asks to have the maftir. We gave it to him and he promised to make a donation of £20,000 by cheque, but he has not given us the cheque."

The policeman turns to Morris and says, "Please give this man the £20,000 cheque you owe him, or else give him back the maftir.

### #2426 The medical test (a slightly naughty joke)

[My thanks to Paul M for the following]

Moshe Levy is lying in bed in a Tel Aviv hospital wearing an oxygen mask tightly over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse soon appears and gives him a partial sponge bath.

"Nurse," mumbles Moshe from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"

Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Mr Levy. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."

Moshe struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"

Concerned that Moshe might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, the nurse overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises Moshe's gown, moves his manhood to one side, looks very closely at his testicles and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Mr Levy. They look fine."

Moshe looks at her for a few seconds, then slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says, very distinctly, "Thank you very much nurse. That was wonderful. You have very soft and silky hands. But now listen very, very carefully to what I'm saying: Are - my - test - results - back?"

### #2428 You're right!

Jonathan and Daniel are having an argument about their shul's policy on donations. But 20 minutes later, after much shouting and waving of arms, neither of them could truthfully say that they were winning the argument. So they agree to ask Rabbi Cohen for his views. Not long afterwards, they get an appointment to see Rabbi Cohen at his home.

Rabbi Cohen and his wife Sarah take Jonathan and Daniel into their lounge and get them to sit down.

"So tell me already," asks Rabbi Cohen, "why did you both want to see me? What exactly is the problem that's causing you both so much anguish?"

Jonathan is first to present his case and he talks for about 5 minutes ending with, "and that's why, rabbi, I think I'm correct."

Rabbi Cohen thinks for a while, then replies, "Umm, I think you are right, Jonathan."

Rabbi Cohen then looks at Daniel and asks, "And what about you, Daniel. So what's your view of the problem?"

"Well, rabbi, I think Jonathan is totally wrong," replies Daniel. And he then spends the next ten minutes explaining the problem from his point of view.

"And that's why, rabbi, I think I am the one that's correct," says Daniel.

Rabbi Cohen thinks for a while, then replies, "Umm, I think you are also right, Daniel."

At this point, Sarah feels she just has to say something. "Rabbi," she says calmly, "these lovely gentlemen sitting opposite you can't both be right. It can't be justified. I think you must here and now make a decision on one or the other of them."

Rabbi Cohen thinks for a while, then tugging his beard replies, "Do you know what Sarah? You are also right."

### #2429 That's how to do it

[My thanks to Cliff JL for the following]

Morris, the owner of a well established and respected third generation family-owned clothing empire meets with his Board of Directors. Due to the recession, business has been very bad - sales are down and costs are up. Morris and his wife Sarah had poured every penny they had back into the business in the hope of keeping it afloat, but things still looked very precarious. And as his Board of Directors could offer no solution, Morris goes to seek advice from Rabbi Levy as a last resort.

With tears running down his face about the three generations of family sacrifice that had gone into building his once-thriving business, Morris pours out the story to his Rabbi. He ends by asking, "So Rabbi, what should I do?"

Rabbi Levy, an old and very wise man, says nothing for a while as he thinks of a solution. Then he quietly replies, "So here's vat I vant you should do. Get a beach chair and a Bible and put dem in your car. Drive down to the water's edge and sit in dis beach chair vit the Bible open on your lap. Then let the sea vind riffle the pages of the open Bible. And ven the pages stop turning in the vind, I vant you should look down at dat page and read the first thing you see. And dat vill be vat you must do," pronounces Rabbi Levy with great certainty.

A year passes and Morris and Sarah pay a return visit to Rabbi Levy in their brand new Lexus sports car. Morris is wearing a new £1,000 handmade suit, and Sarah looks stunning in her new Dior outfit. Immediately, Morris slips an envelope stuffed with money into the Rabbi's pocket and whispers, "Rabbi, this is a little something for you and your wife. There's also a cheque for £5,000 toward your congregation."

"So Morris," says Rabbi Levy, "you did vat I said you should do?"

"Absolutely, rabbi."

"You vent to the beach?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Yes I certainly did," replies Morris.

"And you sat in the beach chair as I said you should, vit the Bible open on your lap?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Yes Rabbi, absolutely," replies Morris.

"And you let the vind riffle through the pages until they stopped?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Yes Rabbi, I certainly did," replies Morris.

"And vat vere the first words that you read on that page?" asks Rabbi Levy.

"Chapter Eleven," replies Morris.

### #2430 A day on the beach

As it's a lovely sunny day, Becky and Morris decide to take their little 3 year old son Shmuel to the beach. They find a nice place on the sands, put up their sun umbrella, sit on their deckchairs, and start to relax. Shmuel is very excited and immediately starts to run towards the sea.

"Shmuel," shouts Becky, "don't go near the water. If you do, you will drown!"

Shmuel walks slowly back to his parents.

A few minutes later, Shmuel grabs hold of his spade and starts digging in the sand.

"Shmuel," shouts Becky, "don't play in the sand. If you do, you'll get sand in your eyes and then well have to take you to the doctor!"

Sadly, Shmuel puts down his spade.

A few minutes later, Shmuel sits down on his little deckchair and starts to sunbathe.

"Shmuel," shouts Becky, "come out of the sun. If you don't, you'll get sunburnt and that could lead to skin cancer."

As Shmuel walks sadly and slowly towards the sun umbrella, Becky turns to Morris and quietly says to him, "Oy vey Morry! Such a nervous child is Shmuel turning out to be."

"No, I'm not ill, thank God," replies Jonathan, "but I'm in shtook. I've just become totally bankrupt. My handbag business has totally collapsed; it's completely gone; it's gornisht."

"Oy gevalt," says Sidney. Last time we met, you were kvelling whilst you were telling me how well it was doing. But things can't be that bad, can they? I bet you've put all your property in your wife's name?"

"Well then," says Sidney, "it's in your children's names then?"

"No Sidney, wrong again," replies Jonathan. "My property is not in my children's names either. But I wish it was."

After an hour or so of this, Rivkah is not only frustrated but also quite hungry. So as they approach a nice looking kosher restaurant, she tries a new tactic to persuade Morris to eat there.

"Oy, Morris," she says smiling, "what do you think of that glorious food smell coming from this kosher restaurant?"

On hearing this, Morris decides to give her a treat. "Yes darling, it's a great smell. So let's walk past the restaurant again."

### #2436 The theological argument

Rabbis Bloom, Levy, Victor and Morris regularly have theological arguments, and whenever they do, three of them are nearly always in accord against the fourth rabbi. Today, the odd rabbi out is Rabbi Victor. But this time, Rabbi Victor decides to appeal to a higher authority.

"Oh God," he cries out, "I know in my heart that I was right and my colleagues were wrong! I would therefore be most grateful if you could give us a sign to prove to my colleagues that they were wrong."

Although it was a beautiful warm sunny day, as soon as Rabbi Victor finishes his prayer, a storm cloud moves across the sky above the four rabbis, rumbles once and then dissolves.

"Aha," says Rabbi Victor, "that was a sign from God. I knew I was right."

But the other three rabbis disagreed, pointing out that it wasn't unusual for storm clouds to form on hot days.

So Rabbi Victor prays again. "Oh God," he cries out, "I need a bigger sign to show my colleagues that I was right and they were wrong. Please God, please give us a bigger sign."

This time five storm clouds suddenly appear above them and rush towards each other to form one big cloud. Then a lightning bolt slams into a nearby field.

"See," says Rabbi Victor to his colleagues, "I told you I was right."

But the other 3 rabbis continue to insist that nothing had happened that couldn't be explained by natural causes.

Then, just as Rabbi Victor is getting ready to ask God for a gigantic sign to end the other three rabbis' disagreement, the sky turns pitch black, the earth starts to shake vigorously, and a deep, booming voice says, "He’s Right!"

Rabbi Victor smiles, turns to the other three rabbis, and says to them, "So nu, my argument was correct was it not?"

"OK, OK, so now it’s 3 to 2," replies one of the other rabbis.

### #2437 The perfect solution

[My thanks to Abe S for the following]

Benny is getting more and more worried about his wife Sharon's aggressive behaviour towards him. So today he decides to see Doctor Levy.

"How can I help you, Benny?" asks Doctor Levy. "What's your problem?"

"I've not come about me, doctor," replies Benny. "It's mine Sharon I've come to talk about. I just don't know how to handle her anymore. Every time I'm with her, Sharon seems to quickly lose her temper for no reason at all - and it's beginning to scare me."

"Don't worry Benny," says doctor Levy. "You'll be pleased to hear that curing such behaviour is now no longer difficult."

"So what medicine are you going to prescribe for her?" asks Benny.

"I don't need to prescribe medicine for her," replies doctor Levy. "Whenever you think Sharon is beginning to loose her temper, just drink some water. But don't swallow it - just swish it around in your mouth. And keep swishing it around until Sharon calms down or else leaves the room."

"Thank you doctor," says Benny. "I will try it as soon as I get back home."

Ten days later, Benny books another appointment to see doctor Levy.

"So how is Sharon's temper problem?" asks doctor Levy.

"Your cure really works, doctor," replies Benny. "I've been swishing water around my mouth every time Sharon starts to get aggressive, and she's now almost normal. I can't thank you enough, doctor. But do tell me, how can a plain glass of water work so well?"

"I must be honest with you Benny," replies doctor Levy, "the water itself does absolutely nothing. It's you keeping your mouth shut that is the solution"

### #2439 Please take

[My thanks to Harvey R and Freda D and others for the following]

Benny is close to death and knows it. He's in bed in his local hospital and around the bed are his wife Sadie, his son Morris, his daughters Leah and Fay, and his nurse Marilyn.

Suddenly, and with a weak voice, Benny starts talking to his family.

"Morris, I want you to take the Heronslea apartments over in Bushey Heath."

"Leah, I want you to take the group of houses at the bottom of California Lane."

"Fay, I want you to take the Kosher shops in the High Road."

"And Sadie, my dear lovely wife who has been so good to me all my life, please take the houses in Merry Hill Lane where the Elstree film studios used to be."

Marilyn is totally shocked when she hears of all this property, and as Benny slowly slips away, she quietly says to Sadie, "Your husband must have been an extremely hard working and successful business man."

"Why do you say this?" asks Sadie.

"Because he has accumulated such a lot of property," replies Marilyn.

"Property shmoperty," says Sadie, "Don't be silly. The shmuck had a milk round."

### #2440 Please get married - 1

[My thanks to John T for the following]

30 year old Moshe remains unmarried. His mother had passed away a few years earlier and he currently lives in a nice apartment just a few miles from his father Jacob. But then, out of the blue, Jacob visits Moshe and gives him some terrible news.

"Look Moshe," says Jacob, "It's important for you to find a wife as soon as possible."

"Why is that, dad?" asks Moshe.

"I'm sorry to have to tell you this son, but Doctor Levy has told me that I've got cancer and have only two years at most to live. So I'd love to see you get married before I pass away. Not only will you be doing a great mitzvah if you do this, but you'll also never ever have to worry about money because I've accumulated a very significant sum from my investment business - millions in fact. So please Moshe, please let me see you get married before I pass away."

With tears running down his face, Moshe hugs and kisses his father and says to him, "I'll really try dad, really. I promise."

A few weeks later, during a business meeting he's attending on the subject of 'Stock Exchange Investments', Moshe notices the most beautiful woman he's ever seen and immediately falls in love with her. He goes over to her and says, "Hi, I'm Moshe and I've fallen in love with you. Would you like to tell me your name?"

"My name is Rebecca," she replies, smiling.

"What a lovely name," says Moshe. "So let me be honest with you Rebecca. You might think that I'm just your average guy, but let me assure you I'm not because in a year or two from now, my sickly father, whom I dearly love, and who lives on his own, is likely to die from cancer and when he does, I'm going to inherit millions of pounds."

They continue chatting and when it's time to depart, Rebecca asks Moshe for his business card. One month later, Rebecca becomes Moshe's stepmother.

[The moral of this story is that Financial Planning is not only a man's strength.]



mitzvah: Good deed

### #2441 Please get married - 2

[My thanks to Malcolm C for the following]

For many years now, Harry and his wife Kitty have been waiting to see their 35 year old son David get married. But nothing seems to be happening on the chuppah front. So they enlist the help of a shadchen named Rachel.

Later that week, Rachel visits David and after finding out some facts about him, Rachel says to him, "there's no need for you to wait any longer for the right girl to appear. I have a lovely young lady in mind who I'm sure will be perfect for you. And before you know it, you'll be married and your parents will be very pleased. So shall I arrange for you to meet this lady?"

"No thank you," replies David. "There's absolutely no need to bother because I have two sisters living with me who have always been willing to take care of me."

"Well that's nice to hear," says Rachel, "but surely all the sisters in the world cannot fill the role of a loving wife?"

"I know I said two sisters," replies David smiling, "but I didn't say they were my two sisters, did I?"



chuppah: a wedding canopy

shadchen: matchmaker

### #2442 Two important questions

[My thanks to Abe S for the following]

Q1: Where can single Jewish men over the age of 50 find younger Jewish women who are interested in them?

A: Look under FICTION in your local bookshop



Q2: What can a Jewish man do while his wife is going through the menopause?

A: Keep busy. If he's handy with tools, he can finish the room in the attic because when it's completed, he'll have a place to live.

### #2443 Satan's questions

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

A few minutes before the Kol Nidre service is scheduled to start, and just as the shul's congregation is sitting quietly waiting for the service to begin, Satan suddenly appears. Instantly there is total panic. Members begin running towards the exits screaming. Many are trampled on as they fall in their frantic effort to get away from the devil. And within minutes, the shul is empty - empty that is except for Morris, a grey-haired 75 year old man who remains sitting calmly in his seat.

Morris seems totally unaware that he has God's ultimate enemy in his presence. Satan, seeing that Morris is the only one remaining in the shul, walks over to Morris and in a booming voice says, "Do you know who I am?"

And in the standard Yiddish manner, Morris replies, "Do you know who I am?"

"You should fear me like the others do," says Satan. "Aren't you afraid of me?"

"No, certainly not" replies Morris.

"But surely you realise that I can kill you instantly without a word being said?" says Satan.

"So nu already, be my guest," replies Morris calmly.

"But don't you know that if I want to, I can cause you unbelievably, horrifying agony for all of eternity?" asks Satan.

"Big deal," replies Morris calmly.

"And you still say that you're not afraid of me?" asks Satan.

"No way," replies Morris.

Morris's replies so shock Satan that he asks Morris one more question, "So tell me already. Why aren't you afraid of me?"

"Because I've been married to your sister for over 50 years!" replies Morris very calmly.

### #2444 Redecoration or what

This week, Hetty has the decorator in to repaint the inside of her house. But on the first day, when her husband Hymie comes home from work, he unfortunately touches the freshly painted bedroom wall and leaves an ugly mark on it.

"Oy vey Hymie," she says to him. "Couldn't you have been more careful? Just look at what you've done. Now I've got to tell the decorator when he arrives tomorrow that he's got to redo this wall. I just hope he'll do it without an extra charge."

So the next day, as soon as the decorator arrives, Hetty goes over to him and with a lovely smile on her face quietly says, "Can I show you where my husband put his hand last night?"

The decorator looks at Hetty, sighs, and says to her, "Look, lady, I've got a tough day's work ahead of me. Why don't you just make us a cup of tea?"

### #2445 How should I know?

[My thanks to Cliff L for the following]

Morris phones British Airways. "Yes, can I help you?" asks the BA booking clerk.

"I'm looking to book a flight to Tel Aviv for this coming Sunday," says Morris, "and I wondered whether there are any seats still available."

"Before I can answer that," says the BA clerk, "I need to know how many people are going to fly with you."

"Oy vey, what a silly question to ask," replies Morris. "How should I know - it's your aircraft, not mine?"

### #2446 At the beach

[My thanks to Linda F for the following version of my earlier joke #575 in the 24th set of jokes]

One sunny afternoon, as Estelle and her young grandson Benny are on the beach, a  tidal wave suddenly sweeps Benny away from her and hurls him far out into the depths of the ocean. Benny quickly disappears.

Crying profusely, Estelle bows down, kneels in the sand, and immediately starts praying to God for the return of her grandson. "Dear God, I have always been a good woman, a good Jew and a loving bubbeh. So please please return my grandson Benny to me in one piece and breathing."

Just as she finishes her prayer, another gigantic wave crashes down on the beach, this one returning Benny to his bubbeh's side.

Estelle immediately begins to cry again, this time in happiness, and she tightly hugs Benny, the grandson that she thought she would never see again. As she looks lovingly at Benny, she is overcome with joy and gratitude. Then suddenly, Estelle looks up at the sky and shouts, "But he had a hat!"



bubbeh: grandma

### #2447 You know you grew up Jewish when:

[My thanks to Vivian BC for the following]

•    You did not respond to the teacher calling roll on the first day of school because you thought your name was "Princess."

•    You spent your entire childhood thinking that everyone  calls roast beef "brisket."

•    Your family dog responds to complaints uttered in Yiddish.

•    You can look at gefilte fish without turning  green.

•    You grew up thinking there was a fish called lox.

•    You can understand some Yiddish but you can't speak it.

•    You have at least six male relatives named Michael or David.

### #2448 Growing up Jewish - a sad story

[My thanks to Vivian BC for the following]

Moshe and Aaron, two observers, are  sent to a remote observation spot in the jungle on a two year tour of duty. There are no other human beings there and they are cut-off from society except for the very latest Apple mobile phone, iPad and printer.

One day, a female gorilla approaches them and Moshe offers it a banana. The gorilla loves it so much that it comes to them each day thereafter. Soon the three of them are getting on so well that the gorilla moves into their living quarters with them.

18 months later, when Moshe and Aaron are contacted by Head Office and told that their tour of duty was over, they are extremely upset. How can they leave their gorilla friend behind? So they discuss it and come up with the idea of smuggling their friend it into UK with them. Using plants and other natural jungle material all around them, Moshe and Aaron make some ladies clothing and a blonde sheitel and dress up the gorilla. Then they forge a passport, giving the gorilla the name Shaineh Maidel, and include a photo of the gorilla in its new clothing.

On the departure date, Moshe and Aaron get the gorilla onto the plane and eventually, many hours later, the three of them arrive at UK customs. They go through the UK citizens gate and are waived through with just a cursory glance and a comment directed at the gorilla from what must be a Jewish official, "So what’s a lovely Jewish girl like you doing with this pair of nogoodnicks?"

And then to cap it all, as soon as the three of them are outside the terminal and looking for a taxi, the gorilla runs off and disappears, never to be seen by them again. Moshe and Aaron remained very distraught for some time afterwards because the gorilla never even sent them a "Thank You" card.



sheitel: wig worn by orthodox married women

shaineh maidel: pretty girl

nogoodnick: a good-for-nothing person

### #2450 Rye Bread - a slightly naughty joke

It's Sunday morning and as usual, 80 year old Benny is walking slowly to the Edgware shops to get some lox, humous, chopped herring and some bagels.  Halfway into his walk he sees his 81 year old friend Morris walking briskly towards him. Morris is wearing running shorts, trainers and a T-shirt.

When they meet, Benny says, "Hi Morris, are you about to go on your morning run?"

"No," replies Morris, "I've already completed my 5 mile run. I'm now just winding down."

"Wow!" says Benny, "I don't know how you can do this at your age. I can't see any sweat on you and you're not even out of breath. What's your secret? Where does all your energy come from?"

Morris always loves bragging about his fitness, so he replies, "Well Benny, if you really want to know, I eat rye bread every day, from first thing in the morning to last thing at night. I just love rye bread. If you did the same thing, it would not only help to keep your energy levels high, but also, once you have a high energy level, you'll develop amazing love-making capabilities. I must go now Benny. Best of luck - and don't forget the rye bread."

As soon as Benny gets to the shops, his first port of call is Grodzinski, the famous bakery. As he's searching on the shelves for the rye bread, a saleslady goes over to him and politely asks, "Can I help you sir?"

"That's very nice of you," replies Benny. "Yes, I do need some help. Do you have any rye bread?"

"Of course we do," she replies with a lovely smile. "We have a whole shelf of it. Would you like me to get you a loaf?"

"Yes," replies Benny. "Please get me five large loaves of your best rye bread."

"Oy vey," she says. "Five loaves! By the time you get to start eating the third loaf, it'll be hard."

On hearing this piece of news, Bennie says to her, "I just can't believe everybody knows about this but me."



lox: smoked salmon

humous: a thick spread made from mashed chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice and garlic; used especially as a dip for pita.

Grodzinski: Kosher bakers established in 1886

### #2451 The 37 year old Bonds

50 year old Moshe had been given some Israeli Bonds as one of his barmitzvah presents and now, 37 years later, he wants to find out what they are worth. So he phones STATE OF ISRAEL BONDS UK.

"Can I help you?" asks the voice on the end of the line.

"I would like to talk to someone about some Bonds I've had for many years," replies Moshe.

"OK," says the voice, "are you looking for redemption or conversion?"

"Hey! what organisation am I talking to?" asks Moshe. "The Israeli Bonds Office or the Christian Missionary Society?"

### #2452 The journey's flaw

Miriam has just returned from her first trip to Israel and is talking to her friend Leah about the trip.  "It was a marvellous holiday," says Miriam, "let down only by my journey there."

"Oh I'm sorry to hear that," says Leah. "So how did you fly there? By chartered flight?"

"No Leah, I didn't fly there on a chartered flight." replies Miriam.

"Then did you manage to go there as part of a special group?" asks Leah.

"No Leah," replies Miriam, "I didn't fly to Israel with a group."

"Well then, did you manage to negotiate a nice discount when you booked the flight?" asks Leah.

"No. There was no discount available," replies Miriam.

"Oy Vey!" says Leah. "Do you mean to tell me that you travelled to Israel retail?"

### #2453 How to buy a pearl necklace

In a few days time it will be Victor and Kitty's 30th wedding anniversary and Victor decides to buy her a string of pearls as a surprise present.  He goes into an expensive West End jewellers shop and asks the assistant to show him a selection of pearl necklaces.

After being shown some very average looking pearl necklaces, Victor asks the assistant to show him something a bit better. So the assistant goes away and returns with a very expensive looking box.

He opens the box, points to the pearls inside and says to Victor, "Just look at the quality of this necklace. This is our best and most expensive pearl necklace. All the pearls in it are 100% cultured."

"Cultured, shmultured," says Victor, "who cares whether the pearls are cultured? All I want to do today is buy my gorgeous Kitty some nice looking pearls. Let someone else pay for their University education, not me.

### #2454 Jewish hardship

Ruth meets her friend Estelle in Brent Cross shopping centre. "Hi Estelle," says Ruth, "I haven't seen you in weeks. How are things with you? I hear that you've had some serious problems recently."

But before Estelle can answer, Ruth goes on, "Is it true that your husband Phillip ran off with his young secretary?"

"Yes, Ruth, it's true," replies Estelle. "But that isn't all. My gorgeous daughter Suzy then gets herself pregnant - and she's still single! Then my clever handsome son Paul, who was doing so well in Law School, suddenly decides to drop out of college and become a Jewish comedian. Then our business goes kapput, and now, on top of all the stress I'm having to cope with, you'll never guess what."

"What is it?" says Ruth. "So tell me already."

"I've got the decorators in," replies Estelle.

### #2455 Honesty is the best policy

David is busy on his computer when his phone rings. "Yes, can I help?" says David.

"I'd like to speak to Naomi Gold," says the caller. "Could you put me onto her please."

"I'm sorry," replies David, "but you've rang the wrong number. This is David Minkoff speaking and I'm currently updating my Jewish jokes website."

"Are you sure Naomi isn't there with you?" asks the caller.

"Of course I am," replies David. "Have I ever lied to you before?"

### #2456  When you wish upon a star

[My thanks to Bob K for the following]

Some years ago, Israel's Finance Minister was charged by the Prime Minister to continue to fund the defence of Israel without raising taxes. Cash was running low after years of struggle.

Desperately, the Finance Minister goes to the IMF and asks for a loan. Naturally, they ask him for some collateral. Inspired, he offers them the Star of David symbol.

The IMF look at it and say to him, "OK, we'll lend you $1m for it."

"But it’s priceless," the Finance Minister protests. "It’s been the symbol of my race for thousands of years and is entirely unique. Don't you know who I am? I am the Finance Minister of Israel."

The IMF reply, "When you wish to pawn a Star, makes no difference who you are."

### #2457 It's over and out

Miriam the bride goes down the aisle and reaches the chuppah. There, standing in front of her, as he should be, is Daniel her future husband. But you can imagine what a shock Miriam gets when she sees that Daniel is standing there with his golf bag and clubs at his side. Miriam immediately says to him, "What on earth are your golf clubs doing here Daniel? Are you serious or what?"

Daniel looks straight at Miriam, eye-to-eye, and replies, "Surely this isn't going to take all day, is it?"



chuppah: wedding canopy

### #2460 A caring man

Oy Vey! 70 year old Isaac has a serious illness and his doctor has just warned him that he doesn't have many more months to live. Isaac immediately decides to leave hospital and spend the rest of his days at home with his wife Rebecca and family all around him.

One night, some weeks later, he's feeling very poorly indeed. There's also a raging storm going on outside their house with flashes of lightening and unbelievably strong winds howling all around. Isaac calls down to Rebecca to come upstairs as he has something important to tell her.

"Darling," he says, "I've never felt so bad as I do now."

"Oh no," cries Rebecca.

"I really think I'm very close to seeing my mummy and daddy again, and also my bubba and zeyda. And of course, God himself."

"Oh Isaac, Isaac," she says, crying profusely.

"And I want to be with a man of the Cloth before I die, so could you please contact Father O'Reilly at St Christopher's Church and ask him to come here as soon as possible."

"But you're Jewish, darling," says Rebecca. "Surely you mean you want me to call Rabbi Levy and ask him to come here?"

"Oh no, Rebecca," says Isaac, "You don't think I would ask Rabbi Levy to come out to see me on a dreadful night like this?"



oy vey!: Oh dear!

bubba: grandmother

zeyda: grandfather

### #2461 Business is picking up

Moshe meets his friend Nicky whilst out shopping. "Hi Nicky," says Moshe, "so how's your law firm doing these days? Are you still managing to pull in all the rich clients?"

"Well Moshe, as you've asked," replies Nicky, "I'll tell you. Business is awful. In fact it's so bad that I recently had to tell my wife that I wanted a divorce. Thank God, at least now I have a client."



---

### #2462 A swift solution

David goes privately to see doctor Levy for a general health check. After giving David a number of tests, doctor Levy says, "All seems OK David other than your blood pressure, which is really quite low. So I'll need to see you again in a few weeks time to re-check your blood pressure."

Dr Levy then gives David his invoice for the morning's work.

David's blood pressure rises immediately!

### #2463 Jewish childbirth as experienced by Jewish mothers-to-be

If you're a Jewish mother-to-be, do you know what a Jewish delivery is going to be like? You don't? Well don't worry. At the first sign of pain, the doctor will give you an injection that makes you go to sleep. Then, once the baby has been safely delivered and the hairdresser has arrived, the doctor will wake you up. Mazeltov!

### #2464 The hotel guest

Moshe and his wife Sadie have booked a 7 day stay at the very famous and exclusive 5 star Claridges Hotel in London. After a long and exhausting flight from New York, they arrive at the hotel at 11pm and after signing in, they go straight to the expensive suite they have booked - aptly called the Claridge's Suite.

Next morning, after breakfast, Moshe goes to Reception and says to one of the staff on duty, "Could you let me have some of your headed stationery please."

Not being on duty the previous evening, the receptionist does not recognise Moshe, so he asks, "Are you a guest at this hotel, sir?"

Moshe replies, somewhat loudly and indignantly, "A guest? You think I'm a guest? I'm paying over £2,000 a day to stay here! So no, I am certainly not a guest."

### #2465 It's not what you think

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Sadly, Morris has just booked his ageing father into a Nursing Home. The Home is some distance away and Morris can't visit his father too often. Nevertheless, 3 days after leaving his father there for the first time, Morris makes an unannounced visit to see how his father is getting on. As soon as Morris walks into his father's room, there was his father sitting on the edge of his bed with two very attractive nurses on each side of him. As Morris watches, his father starts to lean over to the nurse on his right, and almost immediately, the nurse on that side snuggles up close to his father and gently pushes him into a straight sitting position. Then a few moments later, his father starts to lean over to the nurse on the other side. Again, almost immediately, the lovely nurse on that side gently pushes against his father and gets him sitting upright.

Morris walks over to the bed, kisses his father and says to him, "Shalom Dad, I’m so glad these two lovely gorgeous nurses are taking such good care of you. I bet you are really enjoying yourself having them so close to you."

At that, his father beckons Morris to come nearer and when Morris does, his father whispers to him, "Oy vay iz meer, sie lozzen mir nich fartzen!"



Shalom: Peace be with you

Oy vay iz meer, sie lozzen mir nich fartzen: Oh woe is me, they won't let me fart.

### #2466 This I've never seen before

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

One day, as soon as Morris returns home from his office, his wife Becky meets him in the hallway and says, "So tell me already, Morris. Have you ever seen twenty pounds all crumpled up?"

"No I haven't," replies Morris.

Becky gives him a lovely smile, unbuttons the top 3 buttons of her blouse, reaches down into the cleavage and pulls out a crumpled twenty pound note. She gives it to him and says, "Nu?"

Morris takes the crumpled note from her, smiles approvingly, and says, "Nice one darling."

Becky then asks him, "So tell me Morris. Have you ever seen fifty pounds all crumpled up?"

"Uh... no, I haven't," he replies.

Becky gives him another smile, pulls up her skirt, and takes out a crumpled fifty pound note from her panties. "Nu?" she says again.

Morris takes the crumpled note from her, smiles even more approvingly, and says, "Another nice one darling."

Becky then says to him, "OK bubbelah, so now tell me. Have you ever seen thirty-thousand pounds all crumpled up?"

"No! Never ever have I seen thirty-thousand pounds all crumpled up," he replies, "and nor do I ever expect to."

On hearing his response, Becky says to him, looking very worried, "So please go look in the garage, darling."

"Oy gevalt!" says Morris.



nu?: well?

bubbelah: term of endearment

oy gevalt!: an expression of shock, dismay, anxiety

### #2467 One thing leads to another

David's 12 year old grandson Paul comes to visit him holding an expensive looking harmonica in his hand. "Zeyda," says Paul, "look what dad bought me. I've always wanted a real harmonica and now I've got one. Do you want to hear me play it?"

"Of course I do," replies David. "It's a lovely present and you know that I love all kinds of music. But before you show me how well you can play it, let me tell you a story about why music is very important to us. Did you know that music once saved my life?"

"No I didn't," replies Paul. "So what happened zeyda?"

"Well Paul," says David, "many years ago we had a very bad flood here in Edgware. It was so bad that water was pouring into our house so quickly that it got up to our waists. I soon realised that your bubbeh and I had to get out of the house very quickly or we would both drown. So I lifted your bubbeh onto the dining room table and pushed her and the table out of the house. Luckily, she floated to safety."

"And what about you, zeyda, how did you then get out?" asks Paul.

"I accompanied her on the piano, that's how," replies David, smiling. "Now show me how well you can play your new harmonica."



zeyda: grandpa

bubbeh: grandma

### #2468 What the archaeologists found

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following joke]

One day, archaeologists from the Minky University in Jerusalem are taken by surprise when out of the blue they are called into action to help investigate a very extensive tomb just discovered under the City.

They start digging as soon as they arrive at the site and it isn't long before they breach the inner rooms and find the sarcophagus. They immediately cut the seals around the sarcophagus and just as they are opening it, they hear a strange sound coming from inside. It sounds just like a voice.

As they expected, inside the sarcophagus they find a tightly wrapped body of a Mummy. So they start the arduous task of carefully unwrapping yards and yards of linen cloth - all the time with the strange voice coming from inside the Mummy getting louder and clearer.

Finally, when all the cloth has been removed, the voice is now loud and clear enough to understand. This is what they hear. "Drea mich ariba…. Drea mich ariba."

Gently, the archaeologists turn the Mummy over as requested by the voice and now they hear the new words, "kush in toches arein, kush in toches arein"



drea mich ariba: turn me over

Kush in toches arein! (taboo): Kiss my behind! (said to somebody who is annoying you)

### #2469 It's obvious, isn't it?

One Sunday morning, whilst out shopping in Bushey, Moshe meets his friend Irving Rosenbaum.

"Hi Irving," says Moshe. "I'm glad I've met you."

"So nu? Why is that?" asks Irving.

"Because I saw your firm's advert in this week's Jewish Chronicle," replies Moshe, "and it gives your firm's name as

### #2470 A visit to Cain and Abel

[My thanks to Myk P for the following]

Not long after Adam and Eve had been expelled from The Garden of Eden, God decides to visit Earth to see how their first two children, Cain and Abel, are getting on. After meeting with Adam and Eve, he looks for Cain and Abel and soon finds them in a clearing with Abel lying on top of Cain's head.

"My son," says God to Abel, "why are you sitting upon your brother's head?"

Abel replies, "Because, my Lord, I am my brother's kippa."



kippa: skullcap

### #2471 His first day at work

Moshe passes his Insurance Examination and quickly finds a job at the Minky Insurance Company Ltd. At 9.30am on his first day at work, he's called into the office of Mr Minky, the firm's President.

"Welcome to our firm," says Mr Minky. "I hope you'll have a great and successful time with us."

"Thank you sir," replies Moshe. "I'll do my best for you."

"I'm sure you will," says Mr Minky. "OK then, here is your first test. I'd like you to contact Sir Joe Leon and try to sell him one of our policies. My secretary will give you his contact details. Several of our agents have tried to do this in the past, but without success. Maybe you'll have a better approach. But take my advice - if he agrees to open such a Policy with us, it would be advisable for you to bring back a specimen of Mr Leon's urine. Insurance companies often do this for security purposes as well as speed of completion. Best of luck Moshe."

Moshe is thrilled to be given such an early opportunity to prove his worth to the company, so he quickly gets Sir Leon's phone number and arranges to meet with him within the hour.

At 2.30 pm, Moshe returns and goes straight into Mr Minky's office with a newly signed policy in one hand and a bucket in the other.

"I've sold Sir Leon one of our policies," says Moshe.

"Mazeltov Moshe," says Mr Minky. "You seem to have done what no one else here has been able to do. But tell me - what's in the bucket?"

"Well I followed your instructions and sold Sir Leon a Group Policy."

### #2472 Who is she named after?

Leah, a 70 year old bubbeh, is on a tube train taking her granddaughter out for the day when she meets her friend Judith.

"Hello Leah," says Judith, "Is this the granddaughter you've been telling me about?"

"Yes Judith, she certainly is," replies Leah.

"I can't help noticing what a beautiful girl she is," says Judith, "and what a fantastic smile she has. So what's her name?"

"Her name is Shelly," replies Leah, kvelling.

"That's a lovely name," says Judith. "I suppose she was named after the famous English poet?"

"I don't know," replies Leah. "I didn't know that Shelly Temple was a poet."

One shabbes, during a shul service in Chelm, one of the congregants goes over to the rabbi and asks, "I was having an argument with my neighbour the other day and he told me that we Jews cannot eat Pork. Why is that, Rabbi?"

[My thanks to Boris for the following]

Hannah has just got off the phone after talking to her cousin Judith who lives in Edinburgh. Judith told her that since early that morning, the snow there has been coming down very heavily and was not only nearly waist high, but was still falling. As a result, the temperature there had dropped to way below zero and the north wind had increased to near gale force.

Judith also told Hannah that her husband Maurice had done nothing all morning but look through their kitchen window and just stare. Judith said that if the weather gets any worse, she may have to let Maurice in and leave the gardening until another day.

### #2481 A true story (maybe)

When Alan King, the well known excellent Jewish comedian, was told that he had been chosen to perform before Queen Elizabeth 2. He was absolutely thrilled and started at once to practice how he would greet her.

"How do you do your Majesty. I'm honoured to meet you."

"How do you do your Majesty. I'm honoured to meet you."

And he kept on repeating this in the period leading up to his performance to ensure he wouldn't embarrass anyone.

The day of his Royal performance arrived and his comedy act went down very well. Afterwards, Alan, along with the other acts, were presented to the Queen. As she moved down the line towards where he was standing, he became very nervous.

"How do you do Mr King," said the Queen, smiling.

"How do you do Mrs Queen," he replied.

### #2482 The mirror

[My thanks to Vivian C for the following]

Just before midnight, Manny staggers home after an evening out drinking heavily with his workmates. To avoid waking up his wife Ruth, he takes off his shoes and tiptoes towards the stairs leading up to their bedroom. But he misjudges one of the steps and has to catch himself by grabbing hold of the banister. But his body swings around and he lands heavily and painfully on his toches, breaking both of the whisky bottles in his back pockets. Somehow, Manny manages not to scream out in pain. "Oy Vey!" he says to himself, "what have I done to my toches?"

To answer his question, Manny slowly stands up and limps to the hall mirror. He then pulls down his trousers and then his pants, looks at his toches in the mirror, and is shocked to see that it's badly cut and bleeding in a number of places. So he quietly looks around the house and manages to find a box of first aid plasters. Going back to the hall mirror, Manny begins to put a plaster on each place he sees blood. When he finishes, he hides the now empty elastoplast box and shuffles and stumbles his way to bed.

In the morning, Manny wakes up not only with pains in both his head and toches, but also with Ruth staring at him.

"You were drunk last night weren't you?" she asks.

"Why do you say such a horrible thing?" he replies.

"Well," replies Ruth, "it could be the front door that was left open all night; it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs; it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house; it could even be your bloodshot eyes. But mostly, it's all those pieces of elastoplast stuck on our hall mirror."

"Hello," she says. "I'm Miriam, your new neighbour."

"Oh, I'm glad to meet you Miriam," replies her neighbour. "I'm Sharon. Welcome to our apartment block. Is there anything I can help you with?"

"Well, yes there is, now you ask," replies Miriam. "Can you recommend a doctor that I can register with?"

"Of course I can," replies Sharon. "His name is Dr. Minky and his surgery is just around the corner."

"Is he a good doctor?" asks Miriam.

"A good doctor? You bet he is," replies Sharon. "If you're ever at death's doorway, he'll quickly pull you through."

He takes down her address and says, "I'm leaving now. I'll be with you in a few minutes."

As soon as he gets there, Rebecca takes him into her kitchen which is already badly soaked, with water leaking heavily from under the sink. Then, with tears pouring down her cheeks, she says, "I've just spent a fortune having a new kitchen floor laid. And now look at it."

"Please lady, please stop crying," says Nathan. "Your crying is only making it worse."

"And look at my biceps. Awesome aren't they?  And what about my rock hard chest, eh?  I bet you wish you had a body like mine. What have you got? Absolutely nothing as far as I can see."

At this, little Lionel bends down, opens his fly, puts his hand inside and fumbles for a while. Lionel then brings out .... the tail of his shirt. Holding the shirt end, Lionel says, "So tell me, where can you get a beautiful Armani shirt like mine that only cost £13.99?"

It's the eve of Yom Kippur and Rebecca is standing up in her shul's women's balcony chanting aloud, in Hebrew of course, a key prayer of repentance - "Ashamnu, Bogadnu, Gozalnu, Dibarnu-dofie ................". And while she is chanting, she's beating herself with a clenched fist on every word she utters. But instead of beating herself on her breast, as all the women around her, and all the men on the ground floor are doing, Rebecca is beating herself on her pubis. Her friend next to her sees her doing this and whispers to Rebecca, "Becky, you're not supposed to be hitting yourself there. You're supposed to hit yourself here."

Becky replies, "Please Rachel, please leave me alone. I know what I'm doing. I'm beating myself where I sin the most!"

•    Because I'm a man, I must hold the remote control in my hand while I watch television. If the thing has been misplaced, I may miss a whole show looking for it. But once I was able to survive by holding a calculator.

•    Because I'm a man, I never think I'm lost whilst driving. I never think I should stop and ask someone. Why would I listen to a complete stranger? I mean, how on earth could he know where I'm going?

David goes over to his grandfather and asks, "Can you make a sound like a frog, zaydeh?

His grandfather, being in a kind of ill mood replies, "No David, I don't really want to make the sound of a frog right now."

So Henry goes over to his grandfather and asks, "Zaydeh, will you please make a sound like a frog?"

Once again, his grandfather says, "No Henry, not now. I don't really want to do that. I'm in a grumpy mood. Maybe later."

Then Alan goes over to him and says, "Zaydeh, oh please, please, please will you make a sound like a frog?"

"Why do all of you boys want me to make a sound like a frog?" their grandfather asks.

David replies, with a hopeful look on his face, "Well zaydeh, Mummy told us that when you croak, we get to go to Disney World!"

### #2490 A grave story

[My thanks to Vivian B-C for the following]

David's friends, Moshe and Abe, persuade him to join them in a night out in Golders Green, and they take him to the "The Toches Arms" pub. But David is not used to drinking and falls asleep after only three pints of beer. So, tightly holding on to him, Moshe and Abe start walking David to their car.

But after a few minutes of walking, Moshe and Abe decide, in their somewhat shikker state, that it would be a laugh to take David to a cemetery and put him on top of a gravestone to sleep it off. And that is what they do.

At 6am next morning, David wakes up and finds himself on his own, laying on top of a grave. Very worried, he looks up to heaven and says, "As ich laib, vos tee ich do?  Odder as ich laib nisht fer vus daff ich gayen pishen?"

### #2491 Not as bad as it looks

The Titanic is sinking and Louis and his wife Naomi find themselves in the same life raft. Unfortunately however, this life raft has been damaged during the panic to throw it overboard, and it was also very slowly sinking. And to make matters worse, the water around them was ice cold; there are sharks all around them; they have no food or drink; nor is there any kind of weapon or emergency flare on board.

After a few minutes of silence, Louis turns to his wife and says, "I suppose we shouldn't be too ungrateful, Naomi. Things could have been much worse."

"What on earth do you mean - things could have been much worse?" replies Naomi, "Are you meshugga or something? How could it be any worse?"

"Well," replies Louis, "we could have bought return tickets!"

"What's the matter?" asks Aaron.

"My feet are absolutely killing me," replies Monty, "because my shoes are too small."

"Meshugganah," says Aaron, "so why are you wearing shoes that are too small for you?"

"I'll tell you why," replies Monty. "I'm having the worst time of my life, that's why. In the last few weeks, my wife Rachel has regularly been having bad migraine attacks and I can't get near her even to cuddle her; my beautiful daughter Talia has left home to live with a goy; my son Nathan has decided that he doesn't want to continue to study for his degree and is now wasting his time doing absolutely gornisht; and to cap it all, my company has made me redundant, leaving me with no money to pay my bills. But Aaron, when I take these shoes off, life all of a sudden becomes so very much better."

Kitty has been living on her own in a luxury apartment in Bushey UK for over 10 years, ever since her husband died. But on the positive side, her son Henry has been very successful as a businessman, wheeling and dealing all over the world, As a result, he shops at the finest boutiques and department stores during his excursions to the world's major cities.

During his latest trip, this time to Paris, Henry suddenly realises that he won't be able to get back home in time for his mother's 70th birthday. So he posts her via SSD (Special Speedy Delivery) a special iced-box containing not only the finest of Russian caviar but also two bottles of the most expensive of Champagnes.

On the morning of her birthday, Henry phones Kitty and says, "Happy birthday mummy. Did you receive my box?"

"Of course I got your box," replies Kitty in a bored tone of voice.

"So nu? Tell me already. How was it?" asks Henry.

"I'm sorry Schwartz," he says to the body, "I can't allow you to be cremated with such an impressive shlong. It really has to be saved for posterity."

Moshe then very carefully cuts off the shlong, puts it into his briefcase and takes it home with him.

"Darling," he says to his wife Naomi when he arrives home, "I've something very rare to show you." Then just as he opens his briefcase, Naomi takes one look inside and shouts out, "Oy Vey! Schwartz is dead!"

[my thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Morris goes to see Rabbi Levy. "How can I help you Morris?" asks the Rabbi.

"I'm worried about my Hannah's temper, Rabbi," replies Morris. "Quite regularly now, she suddenly loses her temper for no reason at all and it really scares me. I just don't know what to do about it."

Rabbi Levy contemplates for a while, then says, "OK Morris, I think I have the solution. Here's what you must do. Immediately Hannah starts to get angry, take a glass of water and start swishing the water around the inside of your mouth. But don't swallow the water - just swish it around and around your mouth until Hannah calms down."

"OK Rabbi," says Morris, "I don't know why that should work, but I'll give it a try."

Ten days later, looking fresh and relaxed, Morris goes back to see Rabbi Levy. "Rabbi," he says, "that was a brilliant solution of yours. Every time my Hannah started to lose her temper, I did what you said. I swished my mouth with water. I swished and I swished, and while I was swishing, my Hannah calmed right down in front of my eyes. It was a miracle, Rabbi, a true miracle. But why should a glass of water do that?"

"The water itself does nothing, Morris." replies Rabbi Levy. "It's keeping your mouth shut that makes it work."

During his talk, the captain asks, "OK, here's an easy question for you. Suppose you saw an employee fall overboard. What should you do?"

David, one of the clerks, puts his hand up and replies, "I would shout out loud, "MAN OVERBOARD, MAN OVERBOARD."

"Correct," says the captain. "And what would you do if you saw it was one of your managers that had just fallen overboard?"

David replies, "It would depend on which manager."

### #2512 The Hobby

Jonathan goes to visit his old friend Lionel whose wife had recently passed away. As soon as he arrives, Jonathan notices how sad and empty Lionel looked. "What's the matter my friend?" asks Jonathan. "You look so washed out."

"You too would look like me if your wife had just died and you had no children or grandchildren nearby to visit you." replies Lionel.

"I know how hard it is to be so alone," says Jonathan. "As you know, I lost my lovely Sadie five years ago now and that is when I discovered that hobbies kept me from losing my mind. I believe it's absolutely essential for you to find a hobby to take your mind off things."

"But I already have a hobby," says Lionel. "I keep bees."

"Really? So where do you keep your bees?" asks Jonathan.

"I keep them in my bedroom, if you must know," replies Lionel.

"That's a strange place to keep bees," says Jonathan, "don't they sting you whilst you're asleep?"

"No," replies Lionel, "because I keep them inside my wardrobe."

"But surely they escape every time you open your wardrobe door?" says Jonathan.

"No, I keep them locked up inside a large wooden box," says Lionel.

"Well alright," says Jonathan, "I can see now that they can't escape and sting you. And no doubt you've kept them alive by drilling lots of small air holes in the box."

"What for should I have done that?" asks Lionel.

"Are you stupid or something?" replies Jonathan. "To allow them to breathe, that's why. If they can't breathe, they die!"

"So they die," says Lionel, shrugging.

"I can't believe what I'm hearing," says Jonathan. "Are you a shmuck or what? Don't you care if all your bees die?"

"It's only a hobby," replies Lionel.

### #2513 Seeing is believing

[my thanks to Vivian BC for the following]

One day, Moshe falls over in his garden and lands face first on top of a rose bush. Unfortunately, this causes him serious damage to his left eye and eventually results in a glass eye having to be fitted. And every night, Moshe has to put his glass eye in a glass of water by his bedside.

But one day, after Moshe has some shmaltz herring for supper, he wakes up at 1am with a terrible thirst. Feeling drowsy, he reaches for his glass of water and starts to drink, but immediately swallows his glass eye by mistake.

Next morning, Moshe goes to see Dr Frankel. After explaining what had  happened, Moshe is given some strong laxative by Dr Frankel with the instruction, "I want you to carefully watch your motions for the next few days."

"OK, doctor," says Moshe.

But nothing 'emerges' during the following four days, so Moshe goes back to see Dr Frankel. Dr Frankel immediately tells Moshe to drop his trousers and pants and lie face down on his couch. Dr Frankel then carries out a detailed rectal examination.

After two minutes of this, Moshe, still lying on his stomach, asks, "So doctor, can you see anything?"

"No Moshe, I can't see anything yet," replies Dr Frankel.

"That's funny," says Moshe, "I can see you very clearly!"

### #2514 The only solution

After many hours of shopping in London's West End, Leah is having a coffee when she suddenly realises that her diamond necklace is missing. She loves that necklace so much that she immediately phones her husband Jacob and says to him, "Oy Vey, Jacob, I've lost my diamond necklace and I'm just about to start re-visiting the shops I went to earlier. So I'm going to be home a little later than normal. But don't worry about me."

"OK," says Jacob, "best of luck."

Leah then starts re-visiting all the shops she had been to earlier, but no one had seen her necklace. So feeling devastated, Leah makes a sudden decision. She would buy another diamond necklace right now from her favourite Jewellers, even though they were some distance away. She immediately starts walking to the nearest tube station.

Very much later than expected, Leah arrives back home. Jacob immediately gives her a kiss and a hug and says, "I've been so worried about you. Where have you been all this time?"

"I couldn't find my necklace, so I decided to buy myself a new one from Minkys The Jeweller."

"I can't believe you would do this to me," says Jacob. "Knowing how much I worry about you, you suddenly decide to buy a new diamond necklace without my help and advice? And not only that - from an expensive shop that is some distance away from us, even?"

"I'm really sorry," she says to Jacob, "but for me, losing jewellery is just like someone falling off a horse. If they don't immediately get back on the horse, they will never ride a horse again!"

It was a hot Saturday evening in the summer of 1957 and Moshe has a date with Peggy Sue Levy. He arrives at her house and rings the doorbell. The door opens and Sarah, Peggy Sue's mother, warmly welcomes Moshe in. "Shalom Moshe. Peggy Sue will be down soon. So nu? What are you and my daughter planning to do tonight?" she asks him.

"Oh, we'll probably go to Hampstead and grab a bite to eat at Minky's Kosher Deli," replies Moshe. "Then we'll end up by going to a local night club. We love dancing."

"If it will help your evening to go well," Sarah whispers to him, "let me tell you that my Peggy Sue likes to screw."

"Oy gevalt, Mrs Levy. I'm totally surprised to hear that," says Moshe looking incredulous. "Are you joking?"

"Of course I'm not joking," replies Sarah. "As a matter of fact, my Peggy Sue would screw all night if she could."

"Well, thanks for the tip," says Moshe, as he begins thinking about alternate plans for the evening.

"Have fun, children," Sarah says a few minutes later as they are leaving.

Two hours later, a completely dishevelled Peggy Sue bursts into her house and slams the front door behind her.

"What's the matter, bubbeleh?" asks Sarah.

"The Twist, mummy!" Peggy Sue angrily yells at her. "The dance is called the Twist not the Screw!"

I certainly couldn't do that with my David."

"It's easier than you think," replies Becky. "Here's what I do. Whenever I'm angry with Moshe, I just go upstairs and clean the toilet. And my anger instantly ceases."

"So how on earth does cleaning the toilet help you?" asks Esther.

Moshe and his wife Rifka go to see a West End Musical. They are both looking forward to it because Davidus, the lead male dancer in the show, is Jewish and has been receiving rave reviews.

Soon after the show starts, Davidus walks onto the stage and starts doing the most beautiful, energetic and exciting dancing they've seen for a long time. His dances include some Gadi Biton and Rafi Ziv Israeli dances; some moon walking; some break dancing; some acrobatic dancing; and even some rock-and-roll.  Suddenly, Rifka turns to Moshe and pointing to Davidus on the stage says, "I knew I had seen him before. He's the man who proposed to me nearly 20 years ago - before I met you of course. But I quickly rejected him as he just wasn't my type."

With a big grin on his face, Moshe says, "Well it certainly looks like he's still celebrating!"

"So tell me already," Nathan asks Dr. Levy, "how did the operation go?"

"Well Nathan," replies Dr. Levy, "there's good new and there's bad news."

"OK doctor," says Nathan, "give me the bad news first."

"I'm sorry to tell you this Nathan," replies Dr. Levy, "but there was an error during the operation. One of the nurses got your chart mixed up with another patient. Instead of removing your appendix, we removed your putz instead."

"Oy Vey," screams Nathan, "that's terrible. I can't believe this is happening to me. So what can the good news be?"

"The final tests have come back on your appendix and it wasn't cancerous after all." replies Dr Levy.

"Do you see this watch I'm wearing?" says Moshe pointing to it. "It's totally dependable."

"Nu? So why do you tell me this?" asks Aaron. "It looks quite an ordinary watch to me."

"So I'll tell you why," replies Moshe. "It doesn't matter what time it is - whether it's 11am here in London, or 8pm in Tel Aviv, or even midnight in Paris, I can be absolutely, totally sure that my watch will say it's exactly 4am."

### #2531 A sure fire solution

"I could sure do with your help, Joseph," says Isaac to his best friend.

"Nu, so what's your problem?" replies Joseph.

"Whenever I talk to my wife Rebecca," replies Isaac, "she never seems to be interested in what I'm saying."

"It's very common for such a thing to happen," says Joseph, "but thank God, there's a sure fire solution to your problem."

"So tell me already," says Isaac. "What is this solution?"

"You must talk in your sleep," replies Joseph.

### #2532 Time Shift

Today is Joshua and Esther's 50th wedding anniversary and during the day, Joshua has been looking at Esther and giving a lot of silent thought about how he feels about the last 50 years. He then goes over to her and says, "Esther darling, when we married 50 years ago, everything we owned was cheap. We lived together in a very basic two room apartment where I had to sleep on an armchair. We owned  a second-hand two door Ford Anglia and an 8" small black and white television set, both of which were always breaking down. In other words, we lived cheap! But, and here's the best bit, I got to sleep every night with a hot 20 year old beauty."

Esther smiles when she hears this.

"And now," continues Joshua, "50 years later, we are living in a £900,000 four-bedroom detached house in a posh part of Hampstead; we drive a 4 door Lexus Super-Hybrid car; and we watch TV on a 50 inch 3-D monster. But every night I have to sleep with a grey-haired 70 year old lady. Old age is just not fair, Esther."

Esther is, of course, not at all happy to hear this last bit. So she responds to Joshua in no uncertain terms. "So why don't you leave me now? I'll make you your favourite sandwiches before you go. I'm sure you can then easily find a nice sexy hot 20 year old girl who would ensure that you could once again live in a cheap house where you could sleep on a cheap armchair, watch TV on a small cheap black-and-white set, and once again drive a cheap car."

MORAL: Aren't older women great? They really know how to solve an old guy's problems!

### #2533 Special bargaining language

Morris needs a new suit for a forthcoming family bar mitzvah, so he decides to visit his friend's shop, "ISAAC'S MENSWEAR," to see what he can get, quality and price wise.

"Hi Morris," says Isaac when he sees his friend in his shop. "Nice to see you in here at last. You're now inside the best menswear shop in London. There's no bargaining shbargaining in here!"

"I'm glad to hear it," says Morris. "I hate all that bartering that often goes on."

"OK. So what can I show you?" asks Isaac. "What are you looking for?"

"I'm looking to buy a suit for my nephew's bar mitzvah," replies Morris.

"Then I've got the very suit for you," says Isaac. "I'll go get it and show it to you."

Isaac soon comes back with a smart looking navy suit on a hanger and shows it to Morris. "Yes," says Morris, "that's exactly what I'm looking for. So how much is it?"

"Well," replies Isaac, "For this suit, I'm not asking for £230, nor £220, and not even £215. For this lovely smart suit, I'm asking for £210."

"It's a pleasure to be inside my friends shop," says Morris, "so I'm not going to insult you and offer you £130, or £150, or even £160. For this suit I'll give you £170."

"OK Morris," says Isaac, "it's yours for £190."

"It's a metsieh," says Morris. "So wrap it up already - I'll take it."

[My thanks to Hilary A for the following]

Estelle, Nathan and their 10 year old daughter Talia are in a taxi on their way to Edgware Hospital where Talia is scheduled to undergo a tonsillectomy. During their journey, Nathan once again explains to Talia how the procedure is likely to be performed.

As soon as he finishes talking, Talia says to him, "Thanks for explaining this to me again dad, but you've never told me how they will keep my mouth open during the operation."

"It's easy, darling," replies Nathan. "They're going to give you an iphone."

### #2536 Doctor story number 1

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Louis has been a schlemazel all his life and once again, unfortunately, he has a problem - he's been diagnosed with acute Appendicitis and needs to have surgery to remove the infected Appendix.

Louis has the operation the following week and when he comes round from the anesthetic, he sees that doctor Levy is sitting by his bed.

"So tell me already," asks Louis, "how did my operation go?"

"Well Louis," replies doctor Levy, "there's good news and there's bad news."

"So give me the bad news already," says Louis.

"Well I'm terribly sorry to have to tell you this," replies doctor Levy, "but there's been an error. One of my nurses got your medical chart mixed up with another patient of mine and instead of removing your appendix, I removed your putz."

"Oy Veh!" moans Louis, "that's terrible, that's absolutely terrible. Everything seems to be happening to me these days. I don't suppose you've got any good news to tell me?"

"Well you're wrong, Louis," replies doctor Levy. "There actually is some good news. The tests on your putz have come back and it wasn't malignant." replies doctor Levy.

Bernie is taken to hospital for a series of tests and not long after, doctor Morris enters Bernie's room.

"Bernie," says doctor Morris, "I'm sorry to have to tell you this but your tests have come back and the news isn't very good. In fact it's as bad as it could be. It seems that your condition is both terminal and untreatable."

"Oy Veh," cries Bernie. "So how much time do I have left?"

"Eight," replies doctor Morris.

"Eight what?" asks Bernie, "Eight years? Eight months? Eight days?"

Looking at his watch, doctor Morris replies, "eight ........ seven ....... six ........"

### #2538 Honesty is the best policy

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

Shlomo is an honest person always looking for ways to save himself some money. After spending a week with his son and family in London, he returns to Israel with 7 dishwashers. As soon as he arrives at the customs desk, he's met by the Customs Officer who tells him, "Mr Levy, you can only import items duty free as long as they're for your own personal use. But as you have brought back 7 dishwashers, you must pay duty on 6 of them."

"But they're all for my personal use," says Shlomo. "I’m orthodox. So one of them is for milchedik, one for flayshedik, and one for parveh."

"OK Mr Levy," says the Customs Officer, "I can accept that. But what about the other 4 dishwashers?"

Shlomo replies, "I need three of them for Pesach - one for milchedik, one for flayshedik and one for parveh."

"OK, OK Mr Levy," says the Customs Officer, "that now makes 6. But what about the 7th dishwasher? What is that for?"

"Look, let me be honest," replies Shlomo. "Every once in a while I eat a little trayf."



orthodox: practising Jew

milchedik: pertaining to kosher dairy foods

### #2539 Signing in to a new class

[My thanks to Juergen M for the following]

10 year old Joshua has just moved up a class at his Jewish school and on his first day, Mr Levy, his new teacher, wants to find out how religious he is at home. For example, does his family pray at home?

So Mr Levy calls him up to his desk and in front of the class asks him a number of basic questions.

"So Joshua," asks Mr Levy, "what do you do when you sit down for dinner?"

"Nu, I sit down and eat. Mum's a good cook." replies Joshua.

"And what about your parents, Joshua? What do they do immediately they sit down to dinner?" asks Mr Levy.

" So what should they do?" replies Joshua, They also sit down and eat."

"And what usually happens when your meal is over?" asks Mr Levy.

"Well, I get up and leave the room to play on my computer." replies Joshua.

"And what do your parents do?" asks Mr Levy.

"So what should they do?" replies Joshua. "They also get up and leave. Dad watches TV and Mum washes and dries up."

"And just before you fall asleep, Joshua, what do you do?" asks Mr Levy.

"I turn on my side to be more comfortable," replies Joshua.

"And what do your parents do before they go to sleep?" asks Mr Levy.

"Must I really answer this?" replies Joshua. "I know the answer, and you know the answer. But is this the right type of question to be asking me in front of my class?"

### #2540 Real grief

70 year old Morris has cancer and is in bed, close to dying. His wife Hetty and their three grown up sons are grief-stricken and have even called in their rabbi to say some prayers.

As they all huddle around Morris's bed, Morris suddenly asks, in a croaky voice, "Is my eldest son Avrahom here?"

"Yes dad," says Avrahom, "I'm here."

"And is my son Joseph here as well?" asks Morris.

"Yes dad," replies Joseph, "I'm also here."

"And what about Lionel, my youngest son," asks Morris. "Where is he?"

"I'm here dad," replies Lionel, "I'm standing right next to the bed looking at you."

"Well," croaks Morris, "if Avrahom is here and Joseph is here and Lionel is here, who's minding our store?"

### #2541 Good news and bad news

Naomi Lyons goes to see doctor Levy. After examining her very thoroughly, he says to her, "Well Mrs Lyons, I've got some good news for you."

"Oh dear, have I got some bad news for you Miss Lyons," says doctor Levy.

### #2542 High cost of living

Emanuel goes back to his favorite antique shop. He's finally decided to buy the lovely 19th century silver kiddush cup he saw there last week. As soon as he enters the shop, he goes over to Morris, the shop's owner.

"OK," he says to Morris, "I've decided to buy the kiddush cup. You said last week it was £125 so I've brought the cash with me."

"I'm sorry," says Morris, "but this lovely, exquisite kiddush cup is now £150."

"I don't believe it," says Emanuel. "How can that be?"

"Well," replies Morris, "it's because the cost of materials and labour continue to rise."

### #2543 The frum talker

Nathan is talking to his friend David. "Did you know," says Nathan, "that my Rabbi is so frum that he regularly talks to Ha-shem?"

"Really?" says David. "How do you know this?"

"I know because my Rabbi told me this himself," replies Nathan.

"But maybe, .... how can I put this without offending anyone? ... maybe your rabbi wasn't telling you the truth." says David.

"Don't be a shmuck," says Nathan. "Why would a religious man who talks to God lie to me?"

### #2544 The Affair (Part 1)

Moshe is having an affair with his secretary Kate and one afternoon, she persuades him to leave work early and go to her place for an hour or so. He agrees.

Whilst they are enjoying themselves, Moshe suddenly notices the time. He quickly takes off his shoes, goes into Kate's garden, and rubs them for a couple of minutes on the grass and mud. He then puts them back on and drives home to his wife Naomi.

"So where have you been, you shmuck?" shouts Naomi as soon as he walks through the door. "I've been trying to contact you all afternoon, but your iphone was off and no one in your office knew where you were."

"I'm an honest person, darling, and I can't lie to you," replies Moshe. "I've been with my secretary all afternoon at her place."

But Naomi takes one look at his shoes and shouts, "You lying momzer. You fershtinkener. You've been out playing golf again, haven't you?"



momzer: bastard

fershtinkener: stinker

shmuck: idiot, stupid ass

### #2545 The Affair (Part 2)

Not long after getting away with his 'muddy golf shoes' ruse, Moshe is dying and Naomi is sitting at his bedside. Moshe looks up at her and says in a croaky voice, "Naomi, I've something I must confess to you."

"There's no need to," says Naomi.

"But there is," says Moshe, "there really is, because I want to die in peace and go to heaven."

"OK Moshe," says Naomi, "so nu? what is it you want to tell me?"

"I slept with my secretary when you thought I was out playing golf," replies Moshe.

"I know, Moshe, I know," says Naomi. "Now calm down and let the poison work."

### #2546 Mistaken identity

Nathan works for the Post Office and his job is to process mail that has been posted with incomplete or illegible addresses. One day, Nathan comes across a letter addressed in shaky handwriting to Hashem with no actual address on the envelope. So Nathan  opens the envelope and reads the letter inside:



Dear Hashem

Shalom. I'm a widow of 79 and all I have to live on is a small pension. Unfortunately, someone stole my purse yesterday with £55 inside and this was all the money I had left until my next pension payment. As you know, this Sunday coming is Rosh Hashanah, and I have some friends coming over for dinner. Without money, I can't buy any food or drink. I don't even have any family to help me out. You, dear God, are my only hope. Please can you help me?

Yours Sincerely,

Sadie



Nathan is very touched and shows the letter to all his work colleagues. When they read it, each one generously gives Nathan a few pounds to donate to Sadie. Very soon, his collection reaches £50 and the Post Office workers feel very proud (and so they should) to have been able to help an old lady in distress. Nathan puts the money carefully in an empty envelope together with a short anonymous note:



Dear Sadie

Here is some money to make up for the stolen money.

Enjoy!



He then addresses it to Sadie and posts it.



Soon after Rosh Hashanah has ended, Nathan comes across another letter addressed to Hashem. So he opens it. It reads:



Dear Hashem

Shalom. How can I ever thank you enough for what you did for me? Because of your gift of love, I was able to put together a lovely meal for my friends. I told them of your wonderful gift and we had a super day thanks to you.

By the way, there was £5 missing from the envelope - I only received £50. I think it might have been those shnorrers at the Post Office.

Sincerely

Sadie



Hashem: God

Rosh Hashanah: The Jewish New Year

Shalom: Peace be with you

shnorrer: cheapskate

### #2547 Reading the future

Benny Levy has been regularly getting bad headaches so he goes to see Dr. Minky. And after a thorough examination, Dr Minky tells Benny, "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but in order to eliminate your regular headaches, you'll need to undergo an Orchidectomy. If you don't know what this is, it's the removal of your testicles."

Benny immediately cries out,"Oy Veh ... I can't believe this is happening to me."

A few days later, Benny has the operation. And not too surprisingly, during his recovery, he becomes very moody. So his family buys him some gift tokens and suggests that when he leaves hospital, he could use them to buy some nice new clothes to help lift his mood.

The following week, Benny visits an up-market menswear shop in Golders Green and begins by looking at some elegant shirts he could wear for work. As soon as the shop's manager sees Benny holding up and looking closely at a shirt, he goes over to him.

"Good morning sir," says the manager. "What size of shirt are you looking

for?"  Benny replies, "I’m a size 16 and always have been a size 16."

"But sir," says the manager, "looking at you now, you seem to be a size 16 3/4. And if you insist on wearing a size 16, you’ll very likely have some nasty headaches to contend with!"

### #2548 The home visit

Like many other Jewish mothers, Leah, who lives in the heart of North West London, worries every day about her lovely son Paul who is hundreds of miles away studying at Manchester University.

"Is he getting enough to eat?";

"Will he find a nice Jewish girl to marry?";

"Has he got enough nice clothes to wear?";

"Is he keeping away from people who are coughing and sneezing near him?"; etc, etc.

Today, after much worrying about whether Paul is dressing warmly enough, Leah decides to send him two nice long sleeved woollen shirts - one brown and one blue.

A couple of weeks later, at the end of term, Paul decides to return home for a few days to see his parents. After many hours of travelling on a train, he finally arrives at his parents front door. But just as he is about to ring the doorbell, he stops and thinks, "Maybe I should wear one of the shirts Mum recently sent me. It will make her happy." So he opens his suitcase, takes out the shirt on top, which happens to be the blue one, puts it on, closes his case and then rings the door bell. Almost immediately, his mother opens the door and wrapping her arms around him shouts, "Paul, bubbeleh darling, it's so very nice to have you home again."

"I'm also glad to be home again, mum" says Paul.

"And you're even wearing the blue shirt I sent you recently." says Leah, "But there's one thing I'd like to know."

"Oh, and what's that, Mum?" asks Paul.

"You didn't like the brown one?" asks Leah

### #2550 Saychel

One day, 6 year old Becky walks up to her mother Leah, looks at her mother’s hair, and sadly says, "Oh mummy, why is some of your hair white?"

Leah replies, "Well darling, every time you do something wrong and it makes me cry or unhappy, one of my hairs turn white."

Becky thinks about this for a while and then says, "But mummy, how come all of bubbeh's hairs are white?"

### #2551 Honesty is the best policy?

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Leah invites some family and friends to dinner and at the table, she turns to her 6 year old daughter Becky and says, "Darling, would you like to say the blessing?"

"But mummy, I don't know what to say," replies Becky.

"All you need do," says Leah, "is to repeat what you heard Mummy say."

So Becky bows her head and says aloud, "Dear Lord, why on earth did I invite all these people to dinner?"

### #2552 Doing what you're told to do

[My thanks to Alfred J for the following]

Arnold and Judith, two elderly residents at the Nightingale Care Home, are sitting next to each in the lounge. Suddenly, Arnold says to Judith, "I bet you can’t guess how old I am?"

"I bet I can," replies Judith.

"Well I'll bet you can't" says Arnold.

"You’re on," says Judith with a smile. "Now please stand up so that I can properly investigate you."

Arnold does what he's told. Judith then looks him up and she looks him down.

"Now turn around," says Judith.

Arnold does what he's told and Judith looks him up and she looks him down.

"Now turn back around... and .... and drop your trousers," says Judith.

Arnold does what he's told and Judith looks him up and she looks him down. Then she says, "You are 86 years old."

Arnold is absolutely amazed and can't believe what he's just heard. "Oy Veh, Judith," he says, "you’re absolutely right. I am 86. How on earth did you work that out?"

Judith smiles at him and replies, "You told me yesterday."

Moshe immediately drops his magazine, jumps up and cries, "Hey, what's the big idea? I got here two hours before he did!"

### #2554 Better than others

[My thanks to Malcolm C for the following]

Toward the end of the Shabbes morning service, Rabbi Joseph asks his congregation, "How many of you have forgiven your enemies?"

80% held up their hands.

Rabbi Joseph then repeats his question.

All respond this time, except one man, an avid golfer named Clive Kay, who attends shul only when the weather is bad.

"Mr. Kay, it's obviously not a good morning for golf. It's good to see you here today. Are you not willing to forgive your enemies?"

"I don't have any," he replies gruffly.

"Mr. Kay, that is very unusual. How old are you?"

"I'm 98 years old," he replies. The congregation immediately stand up and clap their hands.

"OK, Mr. Kay, would you please come down to the front and tell us all how a person can live 98 years and not have an enemy in the world?"

The old golfer totters down the aisle, stops in front of the pulpit, turns around, faces the congregation, and says simply, "I've outlived the momzers."

### #2555 The chosen one

[My thanks to Harvey R for the following]

One day, all the professional staff of Finkelstein & Cohen, a London firm of solicitors, are called into the chairman's office, one at a time, until only Bernie, the newest, most junior lawyer is left sitting nervously outside.

Finally it's Bernie's turn to be called in. He enters the office and immediately notices the chairman and the other eight directors seated solemnly around a table.

"Bernie," asks the chairman, "have you ever slept with my secretary, Miss Ginsberg?"

"No sir, certainly not." replies Bernie. "I could never do such a thing."

"Are you absolutely sure?" asks the chairman.

"Absolutely sir," replies Bernie. "I've never laid a finger on her."

"Would you swear to that on the torah if asked to do so?" asks the chairman.

"Yes sir," replies Bernie. "I swear I've never had a sexual relationship with your secretary."

"Excellent," says the chairman, smiling at last, "Then I'd like you to be the one to fire her."

### #2556 Hong Kong visit

[My thanks to Hilary R for the following]

Hymie is visiting Hong Kong and while passing through a small neighborhood, he is surprised to see a synagogue. So he decides to go inside. Sure enough, he sees a Chinese Rabbi and a Chinese congregation. The service is lovely and very touching.

When the service ends, the Rabbi stands at the door greeting his congregants. When Hymie goes to leave, the Rabbi says to him, "You're a Jew?"

"Yes, I'm Jewish," replies Hymie.

"Funny," says the Rabbi. "You no look it."

### #2557 The Bible according to children.

The following statements about the Bible were written by children. The statements have not been retouched or bad spelling corrected.

•    Noah's wife was called Joan of Ark because Noah built the ark, which the animals came to in pears.

•    The Jews were a proud people and throughout history they had trouble with unsympathetic Genitals.

•    The first commandment was when Eve told Adam to eat the apple.

•    The seventh commandment is, "Thou shalt not admit adultery".

•    David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar. He fought with the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times.

### #2558 A visit to Dr Chan

Warning - a slightly naughtier joke

On his 84th birthday, Moshe gets given a gift certificate from his wife Ruth. The certificate is for a free appointment with Dr Chan, an unlicensed Chinese  doctor practicing illegally in London, but who is rumored to have a wonderful cure for erectile dysfunction.

After much discussion, Ruth finally persuades Moshe to go see this doctor and the next day he drives to the doctor's address.

After a short chat, Dr Chan hands Moshe a potion and says, "This powerful medicine. You take only one teaspoonful and say aloud, '1-2-3.'  When do this, you become more manly than been before and can perform long as want."

Moshe is delighted to hear this. But before he leaves, Moshe asks Doctor Chan, "How do I stop the medicine from working?"

Dr Chan replies, "Your partner must say, '1-2-3-4.' When do this, medicine not work again until next full moon."

Very eager to see if it works, Moshe returns home, showers, shaves, takes a spoonful of the medicine, and then invites Ruth to join him in the bedroom.

As soon as she enters, he takes off his clothes and loudly says, "1-2-3." Immediately, he was the manliest of men. Ruth is excited to see this and throws off her clothes. She then asks Moshe, "What was the 1-2-3 for?"

AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS WHY WE SHOULD NEVER END OUR SENTENCES WITH A PREPOSITION, BECAUSE WE COULD END UP WITH A DANGLING PARTICIPLE.

### #2559 The big mistake

My wife Julie has been nagging me for several weeks to varnish the wooden seat on our toilet. Today, I finally get round to doing it while she was out and after finishing, I left to take care of another matter before she returned.

When Julie returned, she got undressed to take a shower. But before getting in the shower, she sat on the toilet. Oy veh! Big mistake! As she tries to stand up, she realizes that the not-quite-dry epoxy paint I had used had glued her to the toilet seat.

I got home not long after and quickly realized her predicament. We both pushed and pulled without any success whatsoever. Finally, in desperation, I undid the toilet seat bolts. Julie wrapped a sheet around herself and I drove her to the hospital emergency room.

There, Dr Levy got her into a position where he could study how to free her (try to get a mental picture of this.) Julie tried to lighten the embarrassment of it all by saying, "Well, Doctor, I'll bet you've never seen anything like this before."

Doctor Levy replied, "Actually, I've seen lots of them......I just never saw one mounted and framed."

### #2560 Good news/bad news

[my thanks to Vivian for the following]

My bubbeh always used to ask the paper boy each Friday if he would call in on Shabbes morning to light her gas stove because she was frum. And she would always give him sixpence (old money) to do this.

One Friday, he rang my bubbeh's door bell as usual and gave her the newspaper. But he then said to her, "I'm sorry, but I won't be able to come to light your gas stove tomorrow."

"Oy Vey, why not?" my bubbeh asked.

"Because it's my barmtizvah," he replied.

### #2561 Some Jewish Sayings

•    Genius is 10% inspiration and 50% capital gains

•    It's not the gelt, it's the principal and the interest

•    You can't judge a Jewish jokes book by its author

•    He who uses bad language is an ignorant shmuck

•    Where there's a will, there's an inheritance tax

•    You can fool some of the people all of the time, and a lot of the people some of the time, but you can make a shmuck of yourself anytime

### #2562 What a dog!

Within days of purchasing a lovely dog named Moshe, Avrahom notices that Moshe is very intelligent - he always comes when his name is called no matter what he was doing; he always finds his bone no matter where it's hidden; and he learns new tricks very quickly. He can even balance on one leg for 30 seconds.

Avrahom realizes that Moshe is a very special kind of dog - a Jewish dog, most probably, so he teaches Moshe to wear a kippa. And because Moshe looks so frum in his kippa, Avrahom starts to teach him Hebrew. Not surprisingly, Moshe quickly starts learning and then speaking some Hebrew words in a doggie kind of voice.

But then one morning, Avrahom, realizing that Yom Kippur is only a few days away, phones his rabbi and gets permission to bring Moshe to shul with him.

On Yom Kippur morning, they arrive in shul and the kippa-wearing Moshe is given the seat immediately between Avrahom and a Mr Birnboam. The service begins and immediately Moshe can be heard by those around him praying in Hebrew in a yappy but reasonably clear breathy kind of voice, with heartfelt 'wails' thrown in every now and then. Mr Birnboam turns to Avrahom and whispers, "I just can't believe what I'm seeing and hearing. It looks like your dog is davening. But he can't be, can he? I must be dreaming. If I am, please wake me up immediately."

"No, you're not dreaming Mr Birnboam," whispers Avrahom, "Moshe truly is davening."

"If that's so," whispers Mr Birnboam, "you can get thousands of pounds for such an act on television's THE X FACTOR or BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT."

"Mr Birnboam," whispers Avrahom, "I can assure you that the same thoughts have crossed my mind. But my Moshe has told me in no uncertain terms that he wants to be an Accountant."

### #2563 Is it true what I've heard?

Hannah doesn't normally telephone her friend Rivkah because they regularly meet at Brent Cross shopping Centre. But today, Hannah feels she has to phone first.

"Rivkah," says Hannah, "is it true what I'm hearing about your Melvyn?"

"So tell me already," replies Rivkah, "what have you heard about my lovely Melvyn?"

"Yes Hannah, it's true, I can't lie," replies Rivkah.

"Nu? So where is his office?" asks Hannah.

### #2564 The missing wife

[My thanks to Hap for the following]

Morris goes into a police station to report that his wife Rebecca is missing.

Morris: "I've lost my wife. She went shopping yesterday and has still not come home."

Sergeant: "What is her height, sir?"

Morris: "I think it's 5 foot something."

Sergeant: "And what about her build?"

Morris: She's not slim, but nor is she really fat."

Sergeant: "What colour are her eyes sir?"

Morris: "I don't know, I've never really noticed."

Sergeant: "And what about the colour of her hair?"

Morris: "It changes according to the season and what hairdresser she goes to."

Sergeant: "What clothes was she wearing when you last saw her?"

Morris: "I think she was wearing either a blue dress or else blue jeans. I don't remember exactly."

Sergeant: "Did she go shopping by car?"

Morris: "Yes she did."

Sergeant: "And what is the make of the car?"

It has the Z51 Super Performance Package; larger than normal alloy wheels; GT bucket seats; Satellite Navigation with world-wide coverage, and Direct Injection.

### #2566 The anniversary surprise

[my thanks to Harvey for the following ]

Today is Sadie and Yossel's 60th wedding anniversary. They have lived in the same flat all this time and Sadie, being very frugal, has always handled the family finances. But unknown to Yossel, for each and every day of their 60 years together, Sadie has been putting some money aside.

And now, on the day of their 60th anniversary, Sadie tells Yossel about her secret savings and that she has a big surprise for him. They drive to a new neighborhood and she takes Yossel to a brand new high-rise apartment.  The elevator takes them to the penthouse where Sadie gives Yossel the keys to their new flat.

It's magnificent. It's not only furnished with the finest of modern furniture and décor, but it also has large glass windows, a wrap-around balcony, and has views over the entire city. Sadie asks Yossel to look around the flat while she opens a bottle of celebration Champaign.

Yossel returns 10 minutes later raving about each and every new room, appliance and expensive art work on the walls.

"Sadie," he says, "you’re magnificent! The dining room is marvelous. In fact everything is fantastic. I've even just been to the bathroom - it’s all shiny, white, and has lovely cupboards everywhere. And when I opened one of the doors, the light went on automatically. And later, when I closed the door, the light went out."

"Yossel," says Sadie, "don’t tell me you pished in the refrigerator?"

### #2567 Helping the women

[My thanks to Alfred for the following]

The room is full of pregnant women and their partners, and the class is in full swing. Betty, the instructor, is teaching the women how to breathe properly, and the men how to help their wives and give them confidence.

Betty then announces, "Ladies, I've told you this before, but it won't hurt if I tell it to you again. Exercise is extremely good for you. Walking is especially beneficial. And you men here. (pause) It wouldn’t hurt you to find the time to take your partners on a nice walk."

The room immediately goes quiet. But then Martin raises his hand and asks, "Betty, is it OK if my Helen carries a golf bag while we walk?"

### #2568 The broken watch

[This joke appears in my "naughtier jokes" section ---

### XXX#18. But I don't think it is that naughty. So I've added it here as well. Enjoy!]

David’s watch is not working and he remembers seeing a little shop with clocks and watches in the window. So he goes to the shop to get his watch fixed.

"Can I help you?" asks Joseph, the owner.

"I would like my watch repaired," replies David.

"I'm sorry, but I don't repair watches," says Joseph.

"Well, how much for a new watch then?" asks David.

"I don't sell watches either," replies Joseph.

"You don't sell watches?" asks David in astonishment.

"No, I don't sell watches," replies Joseph.

"Clocks, you sell clocks don't you?" asks David.

"No, I don't sell clocks," replies Joseph.

David is getting exasperated and says to Joseph, "You don't repair watches and you don't sell clocks or watches. So what do you do then?"

"I’m a mohel," replies Joseph.

"Then why do you have all those clocks and watches in your window?" asks David.

"If you were a mohel," replies Joseph, "so tell me. What would you put in your window?"

### #2570 Good timing

Morris owns one of the most popular menswear shops in Golders Green. But one night, his shop is broken into and a lot of his best items of clothing are stolen.

When he hears what has happened, Morris's friend Arnold goes to see him.

"Oy vey Morris," says Arnold, "I've just heard that your shop was broken into and many items were stolen. What a terrible thing to have happened to such a nice guy like you. You must be terribly upset."

"Well to be honest, Arnold," says Morris, "I'm not really as worried as you think I might be."

"So nu Morris, why is that?" asks Arnold.

"Well I was lucky," replies Morris. "The thief broke into my store and stole my items at a very good time."

"Surely no time is a good time for a robbery?" says Arnold. "Why was this a good time for you?"

"Because on the day of the break-in, I had just marked everything down by 40%" replies Morris.

### #2571 Mean behaviour

Jacob believes that he is one of the most kind-hearted husbands in the world - not that his wife Naomi would always agree with such a belief as he was very mean when it came to spending any money!

One day, he and Naomi decide to take a trip to Oxford Circus. They had been walking down Oxford Street for over 45 minutes admiring all the wonderful shops when Naomi begins to feel a bit hungry. So as they pass a restaurant, Naomi hints to him by saying, "Jacob, that restaurant we just passed. What a wonderful smell of food was coming out of it. What do you think?"

Jacob wants to be kind to her, so still holding her hand, he turns around and they walk back past the restaurant again.

### #2573 Not the best of online solutions

"Oy! Am I getting worried about my memory," says 75 year old Renee to her best friend Judith.

"Nu, so why is that?" asks Judith.

"Because every time I go online banking," replies Renee, "I just don't seem to be able to remember my bank's password. I have to try many times before I enter the right code. Do you have such broigus?"

"No I don't, Renee," replies Judith. "I've found a way around such problems."

"So what do you do then?" asks Renee.

"I changed my password to 'INCORRECT'," replies Judith. "Then, if I enter a different code, my computer tells me, "Your password is incorrect."

### #2574 Do you remember?

Benny and his friend Louis are going skiing. They load up Benny's car and head north. After driving for a few hours, they get caught in a terrible snow storm. They pull into a nearby farm and ask the attractive lady who answers the door if they could spend the night there.

"I realise it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself," she explains. "But I'm recently widowed and I'm afraid my neighbours will talk if I let you two stay in my house."

"Don't worry," says Benny. "We'll be happy to sleep in your barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light."

The lady agrees and Benny and Louis find their way to the barn and settle in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, so they go on their way and enjoy a great weekend of skiing.

But nine months later, Benny gets a letter from a lawyer. It takes him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally realises that it's from the lawyer of the attractive widow he and Louis had met on the ski weekend. So he phones Louis and asks, "Louis, do you remember that good looking widow at the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up North about 9 months ago?"

"Yes, I do." replies Louis.

"And did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, leave the barn, and go up to her house to pay her a visit?" asks Benny.

"Well, um, yes," Louis replies, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to admit that I did."

"And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her yours?" asks Benny.

"I'm sorry Benny," replies Louis, "I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?"

"Because she's just died," replies Benny, "and she's left everything to me."

"Jake," says Sam, "this is Sam Rosen. My wife has just died and I need the chevrah kedushah to deal with her body."

"Sam," says Jake, "you're having a bad dream. We buried your wife 3 years ago."

"You don't understand," says Sam, "I remarried last year."

### #2576 I've forgotten already

[my thanks to Ed W for the following]

One day, 75 year old Shmuel, a very Orthodox man, suddenly says to his wife, "Rivkah, I've been thinking about this for 25 years already and I've finally decided to become a Christian."

"Shmuel," says Rivkah, "do what you think is best. You've obviously thought long enough about it already."

So Shmuel goes through and completes the process of conversion. The very next morning, he returns to his corner of the kitchen and starts to lay tefilin. Just then, Rivkah enters the kitchen and sees what he's doing. "Shmuel," she says, "vus machst du? Yesterday you became a Christian and today you're laying tefilin? It doesn't make any sense!"

Shmuel instantly stops what he's doing, slaps himself on his forehead and says, "Goyishe kup!"

### #2577 The Talking Centipede

[my thanks to Vivian B C for the following]

Not being married, David decides that life would be more fun if he had a pet. So he goes to his local pet shop and tells the owner that he wants to buy something unusual. After some discussion, he decides to buy a rare talking centipede which comes in a little white box for use as the centipede's house.

David takes the box with his new friend inside back home and finds a good place for it.

Next day, he decides he'd like to take his new pet to shul with him.

So he goes over to the box and asks the centipede, "Would you like to go to shul with me today? We will have a good time."

But there is no answer from his new pet in the box. This bothers David a bit, so he waits a few minutes and then asks again, "How about going to shul with me and receive some blessings?"

But there is still no answer from his new pet. So David waits a few more minutes thinking about the situation and then decides to invite the centipede one last time.

This time, David puts his face right up against the centipede's box and shouts, "Hey in there! Would you like to go to shul with me and learn about God?"

This time, a little voice is heard from inside the box. "I heard you the first time, David! I'm putting on my shoes!"

### #2578 The parachute club (a very slightly naughtier joke)

[My thanks to Peter M for the following]

Rebecca and her widowed mother Rose are having a chat on the phone. "Mummy," says Rebecca, "why don’t you do something useful with your life?"

"So nu? All of a sudden, sitting around my swimming pool, drinking good wine and relaxing is no longer a good thing?" Rose replies.

"I’m talking about something to make you get out and meet people," Rebecca replies. "Like going down to your local Senior Centre and meeting with the people there. You need to get active, mummy."

The following day, Rose decides to play a prank on her daughter and emails her, "I took your advice Rebecca and I've joined a local parachute club."

Rebecca emails back, "Are you meshuggah mummy? You’re 78 years old and now you want to start jumping out of aeroplanes?"

"Yes," replies Rose, "and I’ve even got a membership card. I'll email it to you."

So Rose emails Rebecca a copy of one she’d made up on her computer.

Rebecca immediately telephones her mother. "Oy vey, mummy!  So where are your glasses? This is a membership card of a prostitute club, not a parachute club!"

"Oy, am I in trouble," says Rose, "I've signed up for at least five jumps a week!"

### #2580 A cheap joke

[My thanks to Alfred for the following joke]

After being away on business, Tim thought it would be nice to bring his wife a little gift.

“How about some perfume?” he asks the cosmetics clerk.

She shows him a bottle costing $50.00.

“That’s a bit much,” says Tim, so she returns with a smaller bottle for $30.00.

“That’s still quite a bit,” Tim complains.

Growing annoyed, the clerk brings out a tiny $15.00 bottle.

“What I mean,” says Tim, “is I’d like to see something really cheap.”

...The clerk hands him a mirror.

### #2581 How very true!

•    My mom used to cut chicken, chop eggs and spread butter on bread on the same cutting board with the same knife and no bleach, but we didn't seem to get food poisoning.

•    Our school sandwiches were wrapped in wax paper in a brown paper bag, without any ice pack coolers, but I can't remember getting E-Coli

•    We all took PE .....and risked permanent injury with a pair of generic gym shoes instead of having cross-training athletic shoes with air cushion soles and built in light reflectors that cost as much as a small car. I can't recall any injuries but they must have happened because they tell us how much safer we are now.

•    We got the cane for doing something wrong at school, they used to call it discipline yet we all grew up to accept the rules and to honour & respect those older than us.

•    We all said prayers in school irrespective of our religion, sang the national anthem and no one got upset.

•    I just can't recall how bored we were without computers, Play Station, Nintendo, X-box or 270 digital TV cable stations.

We weren't!!

•    Oh yeah .... And where was the antibiotics and sterilisation kit

when I got that bee sting? I could have been killed!

•    We played "King of the Hill" on piles of gravel left on vacant building sites and when we got hurt, mom pulled out the bottle of iodine and then we got our backside spanked. Now it's a trip to the emergency room, followed by a 10 day dose of antibiotics and then mom calls the lawyer to sue the contractor for leaving a horribly vicious pile of gravel where it was such a threat

•    How did we ever survive?  Pass this to someone and remember that life's most simple pleasures are very often the best.

### #2582 The learning trip to Rome

Sam and Ruben have just arrived in Rome, and are being shown around the ancient sites there. It was a fantastic tour and then to end it, the guide takes them to The Colosseum.

Ruben is in awe. He is totally taken aback by what he sees and tells Sam, “Wow! I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

“Well Ruben,” says Sam, “it shouldn’t surprise you. It’s exactly like I’ve told you many, many times before. If you don’t have sufficient capital, then you mustn’t start to build.”

### #2585 Now that’s what I call a Jewish mother

One day, Miriam, an attractive daughter, says to her mother Rebecca, “I’ve had enough mum - I’m divorcing Nathan.”

“Oy Veh!” says Rebecca, “Why darling?”

“Because all Nathan wants is sex, sex, and more sex,” replies Miriam. “My vagina now stands open the size of a 50p coin when it used to be the size of a 5p piece."

After a few seconds of silence, Rebecca says to Miriam, “You’re married to a multi-millionaire businessman! You live in an 8 bedroom mansion in Hampstead Garden Suburb! You drive a £200,000 Ferrari! You get £5,000 a week allowance! You take at least 6 holidays a year! And yet now you want to throw it all away over 45p?”

### #2586 THE JEWISH BRA

A young Jewish man walks into the Lingerie Department of Macy’s in New York. He tells the saleslady, "I would like a Jewish bra for my wife size 34 B."

With a quizzical look the saleslady asked, "What kind of bra?"

He repeated, "A Jewish bra. She said to tell you that she wanted a Jewish bra, and that you would know what she wanted."

"Ah, now I remember," said the saleslady. "We don't get as many requests for them as we used to. Most of our customers lately want the Catholic bra, or the Salvation Army bra, or the Presbyterian bra."

Confused, and a little flustered, the man asked “So, what are the differences?"

The saleslady responded. "It is all really quite simple. The Catholic bra supports the masses, the Salvation Army lifts up the fallen, and the Presbyterian bra keeps them staunch and upright."

He mused on that information for a minute and said: "Hmm. I know I'll regret asking, but what does the Jewish bra do?"

“Ah, the Jewish bra," she replied "makes mountains out of molehills”.

### #2587 GOLF JOKE

Moshe was about to start a round of golf and was getting ready to tee off on the first hole when a second golfer approached and asked if he could join him.

Moshe said that he usually played alone, but agreed to the

twosome.

They were even after the first few holes. The second guy said, "We’re about evenly matched, how about playing for £5 a hole?"

Moshe admitted that he wasn't much of a betting man, but agreed to the terms.  The second guy won the remaining sixteen holes with ease. Moshe then paid him £80.

As they were walking off the 18th Green, the second guy was busy counting his £80. He then confessed to Moshe that he was the Pro at a neighbouring course and liked to pick on suckers.

Moshe immediately revealed that he was the local Rabbi.

The Pro was flustered and apologetic, offering to return the money to Moshe.

Moshe said, "You won fair and square and I was foolish to bet with you.  You keep your winnings."

The Pro said, "Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"

Moshe said, "Well, you could come to my Synagogue on Sunday and make a donation. And if you want to bring your Mother and Father along with you, I'll marry them.”

### #2588 NEW JOKE

A group of seniors were sitting around at the Coffee Shop talking about all their ailments.

“My arms have got so weak I can hardly lift this cup of coffee,” said one.

“Yes, I know,” said another. “My cataracts are so bad, I can't even see my coffee.”

“I couldn't even mark an "X" at election time because my hands are so crippled,” volunteered a third.

“What? Speak up! What? I can't hear you,” said an elderly lady.     “I can't turn my head because of the arthritis in my neck,” said one, to which several nodded weakly in agreement.

“My blood pressure pills make me so dizzy!” exclaimed another.

“I forget where I am, and where I'm going,” said another.

“I guess that's the price we pay for getting old,” winced an old man as he slowly shook his head.

The others nodded in agreement.

“Well, count your blessings,” said a woman cheerfully.  “Thank God we can all still drive.”

### #2589 FAMILIES

•    The luckiest man in the world was Adam - he had no mother-in-law.

•    Don’t allow your daughters to learn foreign languages because one tongue is sufficient for a woman.

### #2590 ACTUAL COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY TRAVEL COMPANIES FROM DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS

1. "It's lazy of the local shopkeepers in Puerto Vallarta to close in the afternoons.  I often needed to buy things during 'siesta' time -- this closure of shops should be banned."

2. "We booked an excursion to a water park but no-one told us we had to bring our own swimsuits and towels. We assumed it would be included in the holiday price."

3. "My fiancee and I requested twin-beds when we booked, but instead we were placed in a room with a king-sized bed. We hold you responsible and want to be re-reimbursed for the fact that I became pregnant. This would not have happened if you had put us in the room that we booked."

4. "The beach was too sandy. We had to clean everything when we returned to our room.”

5. "They should not allow topless sunbathing on the beach. It was very distracting for my husband who just wanted to relax.”

6. "No-one told us there would be fish in the water. The children were scared.”

7. "Although the brochure said that there was a fully equipped kitchen, there was no egg-slicer in the drawers."

8. "We went on holiday to Spain and had a problem with the taxi drivers as they were all Spanish."

9. "The roads were uneven and bumpy so we could not read the local guide book during the bus ride to the resort. Because of this, we were unaware of many things that would have made our holiday more fun."

10. "It took us 9 hours to fly home from Jamaica to England. It took the Americans only 3 hours to get home. This seems unfair."

11. "I compared the size of our one-bedroom suite to our friends' three-bedroom suite and ours was significantly smaller."

12. "When we were in Spain, there were too many Spanish people there. The receptionist spoke Spanish, the food was Spanish. No one told us that there would be so many foreigners."

13. "We had to line up outside to catch the boat and there was no air-conditioning."

14. "It is your duty as a tour operator to advise us of noisy or unruly guests before we travel."

15. "I was bitten by a mosquito. The brochure did not mention mosquitoes."

### #2591 How to get to drive the family car

17 year old David has just got his driver's license and asks his father Harry when he can start to drive the family car.

Harry tells David that he will make a deal with him. “OK David,” he says, “before I let you loose on the car, I want you to do three things. I want you to bring your grades up from an average of C to an average of B; I want you to study the Bible more often; and I want you to get your hair cut.  Only then will I talk about your use of the family car.”

David thinks about what his father has just told him and quickly decides that he will accept the offer. So they shake on it.

Six weeks later, Harry says to David, “I’m very pleased to learn that not only have you brought your grades up, but also that you’ve been studying the Bible. But I'm disappointed that you haven't bothered to get your hair cut.”

“I know, Dad,” says David. “I've been thinking about that. But I've noticed in my Bible studies that both Samson and Moses had long hair.”

“But did you also notice,” asks Harry, “that all of them walked everywhere they went?”

### #2592 The bad headaches

Chaim Yankel has been regularly getting bad headaches so he goes to see Dr. Minky.

After a thorough examination, Dr Minky tells Chaim, "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but in order to eliminate your regular

headaches, you'll need to undergo an Orchidectomy. That is, the removal of your testicles."

"Oy Vey," cries out Chaim.

A few days later, Chaim has the operation. But whilst recovering, he  becomes very moody and very angry. So it's suggested by his family that when he leaves the hospital, he should buy himself some nice new clothes to help lift his mood.

The following week, Chaim visits his favourite menswear shop in Golders Green and begins by looking at some nice elegant shirts.

"What size shirt can I help you with?" asks the shop's Manager.

Chaim angrily replies, "I’m a 16 and always have been a 16."

"But Sir," says the manager, "looking at you, you seem to be a 16 3/4. If you insist on wearing a 16, you’ll likely have some nasty headaches to contend with!”

### #2593 Have a holiday on me

Moshe, a travel agent, looks up from his desk and sees an old lady and an old gentleman peering into his shop window at the posters showing glamorous destinations around the world. Moshe has had a very good week and the two sad people outside his window give him a rare feeling of generosity.

He calls them into his shop and says to them, “I know that on your pension you could never hope to have a holiday, so I am sending you off to a fabulous resort at my expense, and I won’t take no for an answer.”

He takes them to his desk and tells his secretary to write two flight tickets and book a room in a five star hotel. They gladly accept and within days are on their way.

About a month later the little old lady comes into Moshe’s shop.

“So nu? How did you like your holiday?” Moshe asks her eagerly.

“The flight was exciting and the room was lovely,” the old lady replies. “I’ve come to thank you. But one thing puzzles me. Who was that alter kocker I had to share the room with?”

### #2594 The Bathtub Test

During a visit to my doctor, I asked him, "How do you determine whether or not an older person should be put in the Nightingale Nursing Home?"

"Well," he said, "we fill up a bathtub, then we offer a teaspoon, a teacup and a bucket to the older person and say, “could you please empty the bathtub as quickly as you can."

"Oh, now I understand," I said to the doctor. "A normal person would use the bucket because it is bigger than the spoon or the teacup."

### #2595 The stressed out father

One day, Moshe picks up a hitchhiker, a young, sexy, beautiful girl, and agrees to drive her home in his car. But during the journey, she suddenly faints inside his car. Moshe immediately takes her to the local hospital. Moshe is now very stressed.

At the hospital, the doctors find out that the girl is pregnant and congratulate Moshe because he’s going to be a father.

Moshe says that he is not the father, but the girl says he is. This is getting very stressful for Moshe.

So Moshe requests a DNA test to prove that he is not the father.

After the tests are completed, the doctor tells Moshe that the tests clearly show that he is infertile and probably has been since birth. Moshe is still very stressed, but also relieved.

Then, on the way back to his house, Moshe suddenly remembers his 5 children at home!

### #2596 Rachel’s speech for David

David, a top company executive, has just delivered an important speech to his Board of Directors and is very, very angry.

As soon as he returns home, he takes his iPhone from his pocket and calls his dance teacher Rachel, as it was she who had kindly agreed to write the speech for him.

As soon as Rachel answers his call, David says to her, “Rachel, I’m sorry to have to tell you but that speech you wrote for me was terrible. It was far too long. The first half was fine, but the second half was so dull and boring that some of the Directors actually walked out on me.”

“But David,” says Rachel, “I gave you two copies of that speech in case you mislaid it.”

### #2597 What I want in a wife and daughter-in-law

A good Chasidic family based in North London is most concerned that their 30-year-old son Paul is still unmarried. So, they call a shadchen and ask him to help find Paul  a good wife.

The shadchen comes over to their house and spends a long time questioning Paul and his parents as to what they want in a wife and daughter-in-law. So they give him a long shopping list of requirements. The shadchen takes a long time reading and thinking, and finally asks to visit the family again.

6 weeks later, the shadchen returns to their house and tells them of a wonderful woman he has found. He says she's just the right age for Paul. She keeps a Glatt Kosher home, she regularly attends shul, knows the prayers by heart, and she’s a wonderful cook.  She also loves children and wants a large family. And to crown it all off, she's gorgeous.

After hearing all this, the family is very impressed and begins to get excited about the prospects of a wedding in the near future. But Paul  pauses and asks inappropriately: 'Is she also good in bed?’

The shadchen replies, 'Some say yes, some say no….’



Chasid: A member of an orthodox religious sect

shadchen: a marriage broker

shul: Synagogue

### #2598 He can’t type

Harry receives the following text from his neighbour Isaac:

“I am so sorry Harry. I've been riddled with guilt and I have to confess -  I have been helping myself to your wife, day and night, when you're not around. In fact, I do this more than you do. I do not get it at home, but that's no excuse.  I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apology with my promise that it won't ever happen again.”

Anguished and betrayed, Harry goes into his kitchen and without a word, goes over to his wife and punches and kicks her. A few minutes  later, Harry receives a second text from Isaac: “Sorry Harry, there was a typo in my text. I meant to write “I was helping myself to your wifi, not your wife . . . . sorry.”

### #C001 Hide and seek

### #C061 A frightening story

Abraham is walking home alone late one foggy night when he hears a strange sound coming from behind him. BUMP BUMP BUMP.  He starts to walk faster, then he looks behind and through the fog he sees an upright coffin bouncing its way down the middle of the road toward him. BUMP BUMP BUMP. Frightened, he starts to run toward his house, but the coffin continues to bounce after him.

Abraham runs faster, but so does the coffin. BUMP BUMP BUMP. He runs even faster, but so does the coffin. BUMP BUMP BUMP.

When Abraham reaches his house, he runs up to his front door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, and slams and locks the door behind him.   But suddenly, the coffin CRASHES through his front door and begins to bounce towards him, with the coffin lid banging up and down all by itself. Clappity – BUMP Clappity – BUMP Clappity – BUMP.

Even more terrified now, Abraham thinks, “who’s in the coffin?” He rushes upstairs to the bathroom as fast as he can and locks himself in. His heart is pounding and his breath is coming in sobbing gasps. But with a loud CRASH, the coffin breaks down the bathroom door. Now it’s bouncing and banging toward him again. Clappity - BUMP Clappity - BUMP Clappity – BUMP.

Abraham screams and reaches for something! Anything! But all he can find is a bottle of cough medicine. Desperate, he throws the cough medicine at the coffin.

AND GUESS WHAT?...  the coffin stops.
