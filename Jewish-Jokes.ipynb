We always talked by phone.\"\n",
      "Martin almost lost his cool and decided that this one he had to see immediately. They flew to Washington and as soon as they landed took a cab to the White House.

George!\" and Bush, with a smile, shouted back: \"Moishe, buddy, come on in and let's have a talk.\"\n",

There, in the middle of thousands of people, the Pope interrupted his prayer. They could see his lips saying \"Moishe\" with a smile in his face. The Pope opened his arms and called Moishe to come close to him by the veranda. Moishe was there, looking for Martin and he saw the exact moment when Martin fainted. The Pope blessed Moishe, Moishe kissed the Pope's staff and ran to where Martin was lying.\n",

(The test pilot parachuted to safety, thank God.)\n",
      "Bernie was devastated; his company redesigned the jet fighter, but the same thing happened at the next test flight--the wings broke off. Very worried, Bernie went to his shul to pray, to ask God where he had gone wrong. The rabbi saw Bernie's sadness, and asked him what was wrong. Bernie decided to pour his heart out to the rabbi. After hearing the problem, the rabbi put his hand on Bernie's shoulder and told him, \"Listen, I know how to solve your problem. All you have to do is drill a row of holes directly above and below where the wing meets the fuselage. If you do this, I absolutely guarantee the wings won't fall off.\"\n",

      "MEYER, a lonely widower, was walking home along Golders Green Road one day, wishing something wonderful would happen to his life when he passed a Pet Store and heard a squawking voice shouting out in Yiddish:\n",
      "\"Quawwwwk...vus macht du...yeah, du...outside, standing like a putzel...eh?\"\n",
      "Meyer couldn't believe what he was hearing.  Suddenly, the proprietor came out of the shop and grabbed Meyer by the sleeve.  \"Come in here and check out this parrot...\"\n",
      "Meyer was soon standing in front of an African Grey. The parrot cocked his little head and said:  \"Vus?  Kenst reddin Yiddish?\"\n",
      "Meyer turned excitedly to the owner.  \"He speaks Yiddish?\"\n",
      "\"Vuh den?  Chinese maybe?\"\n",
      "In a matter of moments, Meyer had written out a cheque for £500 and carried the parrot, still in his cage, out of the shop and into his car. All night he talked with the parrot in Yiddish.  He told the parrot about his father's kosher butcher shop in Neasden; about how beautiful his mother was when she was a young bride; about his family in Israel; about his years of working in the City; and about Birchington, Kent.  The parrot listened and commented.  They shared some nuts and raisons.  The parrot told Meyer of what life was like living in the pet store and how he hated the weekends.  They then both went to sleep.\n",
      "Next morning, Meyer began to put on his tfillin, all the while, saying his prayers.  The parrot demanded to know what he was doing, and when Meyer explained, the parrot wanted to do likewise.  So Meyer went out and bought a hand-made miniature set of tfillin for the parrot.  The parrot wanted to learn to daven and learned every prayer.  He wanted to learn to read Hebrew so Meyer spent weeks and months sitting and teaching the parrot, teaching him Torah. In time, Meyer came to love and count on the parrot as a friend and a Jew.  He had been saved.\n",
      "One morning, on Rosh Hashanah, Meyer rose and got dressed and was about to leave when the parrot demanded to go with him.  Meyer explained that Shul was not place for a bird but the parrot made a terrific argument and was carried to Shul on Meyer's shoulder.\n",
      "Needless to say, they made quite a spectacle and Meyer was questioned by everyone, including the Rabbi and Cantor.  At first they refused to allow a bird into the building on the High Holy Days, but Meyer convinced them to let him in this one time, swearing that the parrot could daven. Some bets were made with Meyer.  Thousands of pounds were bet that the parrot could NOT daven, could NOT speak Yiddish or Hebrew, etc. All eyes were on the African Grey during the service.  The parrot perched on Meyer's shoulder as one prayer and song passed - Meyer heard not a peep from the bird.  He began to become annoyed, slapping at his shoulder and mumbling under his breath, \"Daven!\"\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "\"Daven...parrot, you can daven, so daven...come on, everybody's looking at you!\"\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "After the Rosh Hashanah service was over, Meyer worked out that he owed over four thousand pounds.  He marched home, angry, saying nothing.  Finally several streets away from the Shul, the bird began to sing an old Yiddish song and was happy as could be.\n",
      "Meyer stopped and looked at him.  \"You miserable bird, you cost me over four thousand pounds.  Why?  After I bought you your own tfillin and taught you the morning prayers and taught you to read Hebrew and the Torah. And after you begged me to bring you to Shul on Rosh Hashanah, why? Why did you do this to me?\"\n",
      "\"Don't be a schmuck,\" the parrot replied. \"The odds will be much better on Yom Kippur.\"\n",

      "Meyer’s parrot had died and he was lonely once again. He quickly decided that life would be more fun if he had another pet. So Meyer went back to the Golders Green pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy another pet, but this time a bit more unusual. After some discussion, he finally bought a talking centipede, which came in a little white box to use for his house.\n",
      "Meyer took the box home. He found a good place to put it and decided he would immediately take his new pet to the local pub to have a drink and show it off. He asked the centipede in the box, \"Would you like to go to The Leather Bottle with me and have a beer?\"\n",
      "But there was no answer from his new pet.  This bothered Meyer a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked his pet again, \"How about going to The Leather Bottle and having a drink with me?\"\n",
      "But again, there was no answer from his new friend and pet.  So Meyer waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation.  He decided to ask one more time, this time putting his face up against the centipede's house and shouting, \"Hey, you in there!  Would you like to go to The Leather Bottle and have a drink with me?\"\n",

The rabbi stares at this in amazement.\n",
      "30minutes later, the minister says, \"I need to go to the toilet.\" He, too, gets out of the boat, walks across the water, finds the nearest men's room, walks back across the water and gets into the boat. The rabbi is absolutely dumbfounded!\n",

      "He stands up, puts his feet on the water, and SPLASH, he goes straight down under the water. The priest and minister help him back into the boat. He is embarrassed, not to mention wet, but he knows he can do it if the other two can. So, he stands up again, steps out onto the water, and again, SPLASH!!

He prayed to God, and miraculously, while the storm continued for miles in every direction, he could clearly see his home 20 feet away.\n",
      "The minister told a similar story. He had been out on a small boat when a heavy storm struck. There were 20-foot high waves, and the boat was sure to capsize. He prayed to God, and, while the storm continued all around, for several feet in each direction, the sea calmed, and the minister was able to return safely to port.\n",
      "The rabbi, too, had such a story. One Shabos morning, on the way home from his Shul, he saw a very thick wad of £20 notes in the gutter.

He fell 20 stories but he somehow landed in some thick bushes and only stunned himself. So I ran into my kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the balcony. My aim was perfect – it landed right on top of him, killing him instantly. Unfortunately, all the raw anger got to me. I had a massive heart attack and I died on my balcony.\"\n",

      "Jewish Women: They carry children, they carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love and joy. They smile when they want to scream, sing when they want to cry, cry when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. They wait by the phone for a \"I got home safely\" call after a friend drives home in a storm. They are childcare workers, executives, lawyers, and stay-at-home mums. They fight for what they believe in and they stand up against injustice. They walk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the right schools and to get their family the right health care. They go to the doctor with a frightened friend. They are honest, loyal and forgiving. They are smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But they still know how to use their softer side to make a point. They want to be the best for their family, their friends and themselves. Their hearts break when a friend dies. They have sorrow at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think there is no strength left. They drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you. The heart of a Jewish woman is what makes the world spin! They do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope. They give compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends and all they want back is a hug, a smile and for you to do the same to people you come in contact with.\n",

After some time has passed, she starts looking for a partner, not an easy task, but then Mr Shapiro comes onto the scene. He’s much older than Naomi but is wealthy and presentable, so Naomi accepts his invite for a meal at Bens Kosher Kitchen. They have a good time and start seeing each other on a regular basis. She likes him very much and is glad things are getting serious between them – after all, Leah could do with a new father figure around the house.\n",

He accepts and at once Naomi begins to worry about the one thing that could ruin her chances of marriage - Mr Shapiro has a large wart on his nose. She is worried that Leah will not only stare at it but also laugh at it. No matter how hard she tries, she can’t get the scene out of her mind.\n",

Backers of the move say the city's School District is the first in the state to recognize Hebonics as a valid language and significant attribute of New York culture. According to Howard Schollman, linguistics professor at New York University and renowned Hebonics scholar, the sentence structure of Hebonics derives from middle and eastern European language patterns, as well as Yiddish.\n",
      "Prof. Schollman explains, \"In Hebonics, the response to any question is usually another question -- plus a complaint that is implied or stated. Thus, 'How are you?' may be answered, 'How should I be, with my feet?'\"\n",
      "Schollman says that Hebonics is a superb linguistic vehicle for expressing sarcasm or skepticism.  An example is the repetition of a word with \"sh\" or \"shm\" at the beginning: \"Mountains, shmountains. Stay away. You want a nosebleed?\"\n",
      "Another Hebonics pattern is moving the subject of a sentence to the end, with its pronoun at the beginning: \"It's beautiful, that dress.\"\n",
      "Schollman says one also sees the Hebonics verb moved to the end of the sentence. Thus the response to a remark such as: \"He's slow as a turtle,\" could be: \"Turtle, shmurtle! Like a fly in Vaseline, he walks.\"\n",

You haven’t even told us not to look at her. Why is this rabbi? We’re confused. Is it right or is it wrong to look at girls?\"\n",

Naturally, when the Queen gets to hear of these rumours, she is definitely not amused and immediately begins to look for a suitably experienced tax advisor to stop this nonsense. All the Palace officials tell her that she must get hold of a financial advisor called Hetty Abrams. They also inform her that Hetty is in her 60s, has an excellent reputation for her tax knowledge, but is very direct, often appearing rude.\n",
      "Within days, Hetty Abrams is visited by Carruthers of MI5 and asked discreetly whether she would be willing to help the Queen. Hetty agrees, but only on condition that she is first of all given access to the last 5 years worth of income and expenditure relating to the Queen’s ‘business,’ and then that Prince Philip should attend her meeting with the Queen. All is agreed.\n",
      "Within days, Hetty is working at Buckingham Palace, pouring over the Queen's complicated financial data. There’s a lot of information to go through and this takes many days to digest, but finally, five days after she first arrives, Hetty has finished with the figures and she asks for her meeting with the Queen to be scheduled. The next morning, Hetty is sitting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in a very private room in the Palace.\n",
      "\"Before we start,\" Hetty says, \"I must point out to you that there are some words that I believe are much better replaced by their more accurate Yiddish equivalents. If you don’t understand any of my Yiddish words, please don’t hesitate to ask me to translate.\n",
      "\"OK, Queenie, your Majesty, let me begin. I’ve gone through your books with a fine tooth comb and I have come up with some suggestions for you. First of all, you should immediately shtup some gelt into some trust funds for the aineklach because forever you’re not going to live and the inheritance taxes will fress up your estate just like a chazzer. Next, you should remove completely from your Will that shmendrick son of yours. Charles has enough of an estate of his own already in Cornwall to feed the Weimaraner he married and he’s not likely to have any more kids, at least not with her.  Thirdly, you need to move your toches fast in a straight line and set up trusts as soon as you can for the charities you’ve been supporting over the years. Then you need to ……\"\n",

Not only that, but you’re also talking to us in a strange language and I have not understood much of what you’ve said to us so far. I would therefore prefer you to speak to us from now onwards in the Queen’s English.\"\n",

      "Rabbi Gold, Rabbi Levy, Rabbi Warren and Rabbi Bloom meet in Golders Green, as they regularly do, for a good old theological argument. Unfortunately for Rabbi Bloom, at the end of their heated discussion the other rabbis vote \"3 to 1\" against him.  \n",
      "He always seems to be the loser and can't remember a time when their discussions didn't end up with his three colleagues voting against him.  He's very angry and for the first time, as they leave the building to go home, Rabbi Bloom decides to appeal to a higher authority.\n",
      "\"Blessed are you O Lord,\" he cries, looking upwards towards heaven with his arms raised up high. \"Deep down in my heart, I just know that my argument today was absolutely correct and that my rabbi friends here were wrong. Please Lord, I beseech you, give us a sign to prove to them that I was right.\"\n",
      "The sun had up to then been shining over Golders Green, but all of a sudden a large, dark and menacing cloud moves across the sun, there is a loud clap of thunder, and then as quickly as it arrived the cloud disappears and the sun is once more shining.\n",
      "Rabbi Bloom looks at the other three rabbis and says, \"There you are. I knew I was right all along. God has answered my question.\"\n",
      "But the other three disagree with Rabbi Bloom's conclusion. Rabbi Gold points out, \"It's not that unusual for an odd black cloud to appear on sunny days.\" Rabbi Levy says, \"Nor is it rare for there to be a clap of thunder on sunny days.\" And Rabbi Warren says, \"And what we have just witnessed can easily be explained by natural causes.\"\n",
      "So once again, Rabbi Bloom prays to God. \"O Lord,\" he cries, looking once more into the sky, \"my rabbi friends here still don't believe me. Is it too much to ask that you give us a much greater sign, one that they can't argue with, to show them that they were wrong and I was right?\"\n",
      "The sun had up to then been shining over Golders Green, but suddenly many large, dark and menacing clouds move across the sun, and for the next 5 minutes there are flashes of lightening and loud claps of thunder. Then the sky goes pitch black and a booming voice shakes the very ground on which they are standing. The booming voice shouts, \"RABBI BLOOM IS RIGHT.\"   Then as quickly as they arrived, the clouds disappear and the sun is once more shining. Rabbi Bloom immediately starts dancing up and down with joy. \"I  told you I was right,\" he says with a large smile on his face. \"So now what have you three got to say, eh?\"\n",
      "The three rabbis go into a huddle for a few minutes, then they go over to Rabbi Bloom and say to him, \"OK, so now  it's 3 to 2 against you.\"\n",

      "Finding the shul service impossible to follow?\n",
      "Many people suffer from what is known in religious circles as “Mainstream Judaism”. No need to worry, however.  Our team of spiritual healers have devised a cure and we are making it available to you exclusively today.  Please pass it on to anyone you know who may be suffering in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shul Rules” is your ten step guide to synagogue confidence:\n",
      "1.    If you arrive after the start don’t sit down right away, but instead open the book near the beginning and spend 2 or 3 minutes turning slowly through the pages while mumbling under your breath.  If you recognise any of the Hebrew words, say one or two of them a little louder so those around you can hear.\n",
      "2.    Find a seat just behind someone who looks like they know what’s going on.  (You can tell this person because they are likely to be mumbling to themselves under their breath).  Make sure this person is using the same prayer book as you.  Keep a note of what page they are on by glancing casually over their shoulder every now and again.  A pair of strong magnification glasses may help here. \n",
      "3.    When putting on the tallit wrap it around your head for a few seconds while mumbling under your breath. \n",
      "4.    Liberally sprinkle your time in shul with more barely audible mumbles as you look intently at the pages of your siddur.  Again, the odd word, phrase or line spoken accurately and a little louder than the rest goes down very well.\n",
      "5.    Don’t jump up whenever the person in front does so.  They may be stretching their legs.  Instead, wait a moment until a significant proportion of the congregation are standing.  In this way, even if they are all stretching their legs you won’t look conspicuous.\n",
      "6.    See those guys near the front that are wondering around with an air of assurance?  These are the shammosim.  AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH THESE PEOPLE or you may find yourself being asked to do something strange like opening the doors of the Aron Kodesh or, heaven forbid, saying something in Hebrew out loud to everyone. \n",
      "7.    The easiest way to look the part is to shockel.  I have met people who have won international shockelling competitions without having a clue about where in the service they were.  Advanced shockellers will even shockel when everyone else is sitting.  (Of course, sometimes this may be a disguised leg-stretch). \n",
      "Schockelling is an entire lesson in itself but there are two basic forms.  The “lateral swing” is usually seen in ultra-orthodox congregations.  Here the practitioner is perfectly still from the waist down (feet together, naturally), while the top half of the body repeatedly twists at speed.\n",
      "The “Hammerhead” is more prevalent in mainstream orthodox shuls and, as the name suggests, the congregant looks as if they are trying to bang a nail into the floor with his head.  (I say “his” because women prefer to use this time for kibitzing or kvelling over the way their grandson shockels.).\n",
      "Shockelling mainly takes place during the silent Amidah.  This is about 10 pages during which you have no idea where everyone else is.  All you do know is that if the others were really reading all the prayers involved they would be contenders for the world speed-reading record.  You know when it starts because everyone takes three steps back, then three steps forward, then they bow.  This is your cue to start shockelling while turning the pages of your prayer book approximately every 15 seconds.  The end of the silent Amidah is signalled by everyone taking three short steps back, bowing to the left, the right and the centre and then looking round to see if they won.\n",
      "8.    Is the Rabbi speaking in English and yet you can’t understand what he’s on about?  If so, this is the sermon and it’s your job to look alive.  Paying attention to the sermon is a skill that may take many years to master rather in the way that one learns how to complete cryptic crosswords.  The formula for this particular puzzle is fairly simple:  The narrative of Torah portion you have just heard plus something from local or national news equals “you should go to shul more regularly” or “your home isn’t kosher enough”. \n",
      "9.    Feel free to talk to people near you at any time.  Business and football are particularly appropriate topics of conversation.  Seeking kavanah and listening to the sermon will be regarded with suspicion in most communities.\n",
      "10.    If you can keep your cool until the end of the service you will be rewarded.  At last something that is familiar, and a chance to clear your throat and give it some as you bash out Ein Kelokaynu and Adon Olam just like you did at cheder all those years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final word of warning.  If it goes well and you feel confident enough to go back for a second week running you will be classified as a regular.  This means there is a very good chance you will be asked to be the next synagogue chairman.\n",

They always argue about it, but Moshe can never get Rachel to see his side of things. So one morning he prays to God. \"Dear Lord, please help me show my wife Rachel just what I have to go through every day. So I wish that Rachel and I could swap bodies for a day thus allowing her to see exactly what I have to go through.\"\n",

He then sits down for a quick bite to eat - a couple of slices of challah with some sardines and cucumber and a cup of tea. After he's washed and dried up, he goes upstairs, makes the three beds, picks up all the clothing littered on the floor and puts them in the washing machine.

Back home, he makes them some milk shakes (one raspberry and one blackcurrant) and puts some biscuits on a plate.  When they've finished, he washes up then spends time helping them with their homework - one has the history of King James I and the other has the life of Abraham and Sarah.  Later, the boys rush upstairs to play on their computers. Moshe gets out the ironing board and does some ironing, interspersed with going upstairs on a regular basis to check that neither boy is looking at any prohibited material. He then peels the potatoes, washes and slices the vegetables, cuts the bread, and peels the fruit in readiness for their evening meal (tonight it's roast chicken.)\n",

Eventually Moshe gets the children washed, dried and put into bed. He then goes downstairs and puts his feet up. He watches TV for a while. Not long after, Moshe goes to bed - and although he's tired out and just wants to go to sleep, his 'husband' first of all requires some lovemaking.

Even though I think I'm still in good shape from all the walking I do, I've decided that for my birthday, I'm going to purchase 5 days with a personal trainer at my local gym. I've always wanted to give it a try. But dad thinks I must be meshugga to try. He said, \"You've got no saychel. Anyone who wants to work out in a gym has a loch in kop.\"  Nevertheless, I made a reservation with a personal trainer named Barry. He told me over the phone that he was 23 years old, has been an aerobics instructor for over two years, and also models for a Jewish swimwear company.\n",

Not only is Barry a ying mit bainer, he's also got lovely blond hair, beautiful hypnotic eyes, an absolutely dazzling smile, and a great toches. He started by giving me a tour of the gym and explaining all the machines. He then focused on some basic training and was very encouraging as I did my sit-ups, even though my stomach was aching from holding it in every time he came near me. Before I left for the day, I enjoyed watching the skilful way in which he conducted his aerobics class.\n",

As soon as I arrived at the gym, Barry told me to lie down on my back. He then gave me an iron bar and immediately put some heavy weights on it. He then told me to push the loaded bar up and down in the air. What a chutzpah! I had never done this before and after doing this lifting up and down for some time, oy, was I shvitzing! Then, without letting me get my breath back, he put me on one of the treadmills and ran it at slow speed. I was hoping it would develop a glitch. But no such luck. I actually ran 1 mile and when I got off, my legs felt like jelly. Even though I was very tired, I still thought it worth while because of the lovely, sexy smile Barry gave me when I left.\n",

Soon after I arrived, as if my painful body wasn't enough, Barry got broyges with me because he said my kvitching was bothering other members. And I noticed that when he scolds, his voice turns into a nasally whine. I almost gave him a klop where it would hurt him most but changed my mind at the last moment. What a k'nocker he's becoming.  My chest hurt when I got on the treadmill, so Barry took me off and instead put me on the stair monster. Why would someone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? Barry told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life better. He said some other drek too. I ended up totally oysgemitchet. \n",

      "[My thanks to Tony L and John B (separately) for the following]\n",
      "You might have thought that you knew how the Internet started, but here is  the true story.\n",
      "In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot.\n",
      "And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg.\n",
      "Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.\n",
      "And she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n",
      "And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, dear?\"\n",
      "And Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns, and drums in between, to send messages saying what you have for sale. And they will reply telling you who hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS).\"\n",
      "Abraham thought long and hard and decided that he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And soon the drums rang out and were an immediate success. So Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.\n",
      "Later, to prevent neighbouring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was called Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS). And she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures called Hebrew To The People (HTTP).\n",
      "But Abraham's success did soon arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and began to siphon off some of Abraham's business. But he was soon discovered, arrested and prosecuted - for insider trading.\n",
      "Soon after, the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS.\n",
      "And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. And he did insist on drums being made that would work only with Brother Gates' drumheads and drumsticks.\n",
      "And Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\"\n",
      "And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known, he said, \"We need a name that reflects what we are.\"\n",
      "And Dot replied, How about \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \"Yahoo,\" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com.\n",
      "Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). And that's how the Internet began.\n",

As our hand luggage was in an overhead locker two rows behind me, I decided to be ready to get up and retrieve our hand luggage as soon as the plane had stopped and before the hordes of passengers on nearby seats all got up and converged around me. Clever me!\n",

No one else had yet got up because the seat belt sign had not yet been turned off. But then suddenly, the plane lurched forward a very, very tiny bit, but it was enough to cause me to severely struggle to keep my balance. All those seated around me, including a stewardess, saw how I nearly fell over.

We thought we were going to have the three seats to ourselves, but then, right at the last moment, a very large Muslim lady wearing her full length white gown came waddling down the aisle towards us and we realised that she was going to be our companion on the flight. We had no trouble with this arrangement other than the fact that my wife and I like regularly getting out of our seats to stretch and exercise our legs in the aisle. Our companion, being so overweight, would probably not like having to get up regularly to let us out. So quick as a flash, I put on my best smile and asked her whether she would like the window seat. To our surprise she said she would love it. So we exchanged seats and our 'problem' was solved.  \n",

When our in-flight meals were being served, the stewardess came to our row, leaned over to our companion in the window seat and said to her, \"Here you are madam, here is the kosher meal you ordered.\" I had forgotten that my wife and I had ordered kosher meals for this flight. And the stewardess did not know that we had altered our seating arrangements. Oy, was I amused! \n",

So she says to him, \"Oy Ruben, darling, you don't look too well. What's the matter, my lovely haimisheh mensch? You know you can tell me.\"\n",

Oy vey, Golda, I think we're in deep trouble for the first time ever and your husband just doesn't know what to do.\"\n",
      "When she hears this, Golda says, \"The first thing you must do, Ruben, is to pull yourself together because I know what we must do. The answer is quite simple. Thank God, in the 25 years of our marriage, we've always had a roof over our heads; we've always had plenty of nosh on our plates; we've always been able to dress well and go on holiday each year; and we've been able to support our lovely Lionel while he studied. And where, may I ask, did all the money come from if not from our store? And nothing much has changed. We haven't changed, even if we look a teeny-weeny bit older; our store is the same; even our customers are mostly the same. So what then is different? Well I'll tell you Ruben, I'll tell you what's different. We now have an accountant, that's what's different. So we'll just have to get rid of him!\"\n",
